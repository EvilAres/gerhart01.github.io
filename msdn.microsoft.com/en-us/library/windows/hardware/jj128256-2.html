        <p>This publication of the Windows Hardware Certification Requirements provides an update to the September 30, 2013 publication. These requirement changes are intended to relax the Windows 8.1 system and device requirements and give our partners greater flexibility in designing and differentiating their products in 2014.  </p>
        <p>It is important to understand that the changes are to remove or modify the specific requirements that are listed under Summary of Changes only.  All other requirements will remain to support device interoperability, compatibility with Windows, and application platform consistency. The tests that are associated with these removed or modified requirements will remain in the HCK to aid in your testing and measurement of your system’s quality. A set of HCK filters will be provided for the purposes of achieving a passing result needed for certification.</p>

      <div id="sectionSection2" class="section">
        <p>This document contains the Windows Hardware Certification Requirements for Windows 8.1 Client and Windows Server 2012 R2 Certified Systems. These requirements are the Microsoft guidelines for designing systems which successfully meet Windows performance, quality, and feature criteria, to assure the optimum Windows 8.1 computing experience. Successfully following this guidance allows a partner to receive certification for their system.</p>
        <p>The requirements are organized by feature using a Camel Case naming convention, which facilitates grouping related requirements and communicating their relationship to the Windows feature they are intended to support. Tests assessing compliance with the features are exposed during testing with the Hardware Certification Kit and can be related directly back to these requirements.</p>
        <p>Some requirements have passed forward from Logo requirements for earlier Windows versions, which used a category based structure. We have included the older LogoPoint ID in the comments section for your convenience.</p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="heading">Certified Devices in Systems</h2>
      <div id="sectionSection3" class="section">
        <p>A Windows Certified System is composed of Windows certified components. These internal devices are certified before system integration, leaving the focus of system testing on those features which require the coordination of multiple components or configuration settings unique to the system under test. At the system certification level, if the system includes a device or component, then all the requirements associated with that device as exposed to Windows must be met. We encourage a review of the requirements for each system component incorporated into the design of a system.</p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="heading">Optional Features and "If Implemented" Requirements</h2>
      <div id="sectionSection4" class="section">
        <p>The Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK) automatically detects all features implemented in a product. When the detected features include all required features that are needed to define a product type, then the product is certifiable for that product type.</p>
        <p>If additional functionality is implemented in the system design beyond the minimum list of features and their underlying requirements for a given product type, then the Windows HCK identifies those additional features and tests them for compliance with the corresponding requirements. Because these optional requirements apply only if the optional features are implemented, these requirements are identified as "If Implemented" in this document. If an optional feature is exposed, the associated "If implemented" requirements must be met for the system to be successfully certified.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>All Windows systems must be capable of starting the Aero theme, by meeting the following requirements. All Windows systems must enable the Aero theme by default when running with a version of Windows that includes Aero. Requirements: </p>
          <p>All video hardware in all system form factors must support a minimum 32 bpp. </p>
          <p>All systems must meet the following DirectX requirements: </p>
          <p>All Windows 7 systems are required to either support the D3De9X interface and be Direct3D 9.x compliant, OR support Direct3D 10 or greater.</p>
          <p>All Windows 7 systems except ultra-mobile form factor PCs are required to include graphics hardware that supports Direct3D 10 or greater. </p>
          <p>All Windows 7 ultra-mobile form factor PCs are required to either support the D3De9X interface and be Direct3D 9.x compliant, or support Direct3D 10 or greater.</p>
          <p>All systems must meet the following minimum video memory size requirements.  </p>
          <p>For desktop that ship with a monitor and have one video port connector, all-in-one systems that do not have a video port for a second monitor, and for all mobile and ultra mobile systems, the following amount of total graphics memory (either discrete and/or total non-local) is required for specified monitor resolutions. Monitor resolutions are expressed as total pixels (X dimension multiplied by Y dimension):</p>
          <p>Resolution less than 1,310,720 (1280x1024) pixels include 64MB.</p>
          <p>Resolutions equal to or greater than 1,310,720 (1280x1024) pixels and equal to or less than 2,304,000 (1920x1200) pixels include 128MB.</p>
          <p>Resolutions greater than 2,304,000 (1920x1200) pixels include 256MB.</p>
          <p>For desktop systems that do not ship with a monitor, a minimum of 128MB of total graphics memory (either discrete and/or total non-local) memory is required.</p>
          <p>For all dual monitor capable desktop systems that ship with a monitor (systems with two physical and operational monitor connections)</p>
          <p>Resolution less than 2,621,440 (1280x1024 by 2) pixels includes 128MB.</p>
          <p>Resolutions equal to or greater than 2,621,440 (1280x1024 by 2) pixels includes 256MB.</p>
          <p>For dual monitor capable desktop systems that do not ship with a monitor, 256MB of total graphics memory (either discrete and/or total non-local) memory is required. </p>
          <p>Mobile and ultra mobile systems with dual monitor capabilities are excluded from the dual monitor desktop requirements and are treated as single monitor systems. This is due to the different usage models and that external monitor ports are often used in mirroring or "duplicate" mode. </p>
          <p>Systems must meet the following minimum video memory performance requirements, as measured by WinSAT: </p>
          <p>Desktop systems must have a measured memory bandwidth of 1,600 megabytes per second (MB/s) at a monitor resolution of 1,310,720 (equivalent to 1280x1024).</p>
          <p>Mobile systems and all-in-one designs must achieve a measured bandwidth of 1,600 megabytes per second (MB/s) measured at the native resolution of the shipping panel. </p>
          <p>Ultra mobile systems have no minimum video memory performance requirement. </p>
          <p>Design Notes:Memory requirements described here are for usable or active connectors. Microsoft does not recommend supporting fewer active connections than available connectors on a given system as this causes failed expectations and poor user experience.  If a system supports m connectors, but limits the number of active connections to n (where n &lt; m), then memory requirements are applicable for n connectors as long as there is no way for a user to activate greater than n connections at any time.</p>

          <p>For Certifying Bluetooth controllers for Windows 8.1:</p>
          <p>When turning the radio “off”, Bluetooth controllers shall be powered down to its lowest supported power state and no transmission/reception shall take place.  Windows will terminate Bluetooth activity by unloading the inbox protocol drivers and their children, submitting the HCI_Reset command to the controller, and then setting the controller to the D3 logical power state, allowing bus drivers to power down the radio as appropriate.  The radio can be completely powered off if a bus-supported method is available to turn the radio back on.  No additional vendor software control components will be supported. </p>
          <p>On turning the radio back on, the Windows Bluetooth stack shall resume the device to D0, allowing bus drivers to restart the device.  The Windows Bluetooth stack shall then reinitialize the Bluetooth components of the controller.</p>
          <p>Bluetooth Radio Management in Windows 8.1 shall only be enabled for internal Bluetooth 4.0 controllers.</p>
          <p>For Windows 8 Certified controllers on upgrade to Windows 8.1:</p>
          <p>On upgrade to Windows 8.1, previous DLL support for Bluetooth 4.0 controllers shall be ignored and the Bluetooth controller is expected to be, at a minimum, in a state where there is no transmission/reception from the antenna.  </p>
          <p>For Certifying Bluetooth controllers for Windows 8 only:</p>
          <p>The previous requirement remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>Bluetooth controllers’ On/Off state shall be controllable via software as described in Bluetooth Software Radio Switch The Off state is defined, at a minimum, as disabling the antenna component of the Bluetooth module so there can be no transmission/reception. There must not be any hardware-only switches to control power to the Bluetooth radio.  </p>
          <p>The radio must maintain on/off state across sleep and reboot.</p>

                <p>Windows 8 is optimized for thin and light, touch based tablet devices. One of the key attributes of such a device is a long battery life. On a device like this, one of the largest consumers of power is the display backlight. The amount of power consumed is directly proportional to the brightness level produced by the backlight. The Windows hardware ecosystem has innovated in this area and designed algorithms to consume less battery power by optimizing the backlight level in certain scenarios without having a significant negative impact on the user experience. This can be achieved by enhancing the colors of individual pixels to compensate for the lower backlight level of the display. There are some scenarios where such an optimization can be enabled without having a significant negative impact on the user experience. The key characteristics of such a scenario are a series of rapidly changing frames. This is typically seen in scenarios like video playback. Other possibilities are game play.   However, there is one challenge with this. Windows 8 has been designed to provide a visually rich user experience. Enabling a power saving optimization like this during a scenario that requires a rich visual experience could have an undesired impact on the user experience. In particular there are some scenarios which require the best visual experience. For example, image viewing, Start page, graphics design, etc.  So this means that we need to establish a scenario based policy on whether or not to enable such optimizations. The policy would need to balance the rich visual experience against the desired battery life.  This is called scenario based backlight power optimization. This feature allows a graphics vendor to enable such optimization at the right times and save batter power, without having significant impact on the user experience.</p>

          <p>The Windows® Mobility Center provides users with an LCD brightness control user interface. If the system implements keys that are invisible to the operating system, these keys must use Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) methods. These keys must not directly control the brightness after Bit 2 of the _DOS method has been set. This requires the implementation of ACPI brightness methods in the system firmware.   The following methods are required:    </p>
          <p>_BCL </p>
          <p>_BCM  </p>
          <p>Bit 2 of the _DOS method must be disabled so that the system firmware cannot change the brightness levels automatically. The following methods are optional:  Support for the _BQC method is highly recommended but not required. Systems must map keys to the following ACPI notification values:  </p>
          <p>ACPI_NOTIFY_CYCLE_BRIGHTNESS_HOTKEY 0x85</p>
          <p>ACPI_NOTIFY_INC_BRIGHTNESS_HOTKEY 0x86</p>
          <p>ACPI_NOTIFY_DEC_BRIGHTNESS_HOTKEY 0x87</p>
          <p>ACPI_NOTIFY_ZERO_BRIGHTNESS_HOTKEY 0x88</p>
          <p>Design Notes:  The _BCL and _BCM methods in the firmware enable the operating system to query the brightness range and values and to set new values. Refer to the ACPI 3.0 specification for more details.</p>

          <p>All Windows 8 systems that support brightness control, are required to support smooth brightness control</p>
          <p>All Windows 8 systems are required to report  101 brightness levels to Windows. Brightness is reported as a % so this means 0 to 100 levels, including 0 and 100. Internally the driver might support more granular brightness control.</p>
          <p>This is to ensure that Windows has the ability to make fine grained changes to the screen brightness. However, the brightness slider UI might expose fewer levels through the slider because it might be cumbersome for the user to adjust so many levels. </p>
          <p>WDDM driver is required to implement smooth brightness control in the driver without depending on the embedded controller (EC) for the smoothness.</p>
          <p>WDDM driver is required to indicate support for smooth brightness control using the capability bit defined in the DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_INTERFACE2 interface.</p>
          <p>WDDM driver must enable/disable smooth brightness control based on state set using DxgkDdiSetBrightnessState.</p>
          <p>When Windows requests a change to brightness, driver is required to gradually change the brightness level over time so that the change is not a step.</p>
          <p>WDDM driver is allowed to select an appropriate slope for transition. However, the transition must complete in less than 2s.</p>
          <p>WDDM driver is allowed to alter the slope based on panel characteristics to ensure smoothness of brightness control.</p>
          <p>WDDM driver is required to start responding immediately to new brightness level requests. This must be honored even if the system is already in the process of an existing transition. At such a time, the system must stop the existing transition at the current level and start the new transition from the current position. This will ensure that when a user is using the slider to manually adjust the brightness, the brightness control is still responsive and not sluggish.  </p>
          <p>WDDM driver is required to continue supporting smooth brightness control, even if content based adaptive brightness optimization is currently in effect.</p>
          <p>When WDDM driver is pnp started, it must detect the brightness level applied by the firmware and smoothly transition from that level to the level set by Windows.</p>
          <p>Connecting additional display devices to the system must not impact the ability to do smooth brightness control on the integrated panel of the system.</p>
          <p>Brightness levels are represented as a % in Windows. Therefore there is no absolute mapping between brightness % level and physical brightness level. For Windows 8, the following is the guidance </p>

          <p>Comments  </p>
          <p>A counter is a readable register that can be used to measure elapsed time between reads, whereas a timer is capable of generating an interrupt after a predetermined interval. They can both be implemented in a single block or separately. The separation in this document is based on how they are used by the OS, and doesn't necessarily imply implementation requirements.</p>
          <p>Accurate EFI stall is a stall implementation that synchronizes to the edge of a fixed frequency clock, such that the additional delay introduced on top of any requested stall, is bounded by one clock cycle of that fixed frequency clock.</p>
          <p>The requirement for multiple cores is based on implementations available at this writing.  High performance single-core processors may be approved on a case-by-case basis.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>Every firmware on a Windows 8 client system must support the Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) as defined in UEFI 2.3.1.  The display is controlled by the system UEFI before the WDDM graphics driver takes over. GOP must be available when the Windows EFI boot manager loads.  VBIOS is not supported. It is also required for prior UI, such as OEM logo, firmware setup, or password prompt screens to enable GOP. During this time when the firmware is in control, the following are the requirements:Topology Selection</p>
          <p>UEFI must reliably detect all the displays that are connected to the POST adapter. The Pre-OS screen can only be displayed on a display connected to the POST adapter. </p>
          <p>In case multiple displays are detected, UEFI must display the Pre-OS screen based on the following logic</p>
          <p>System with an Integrated display(Laptop, All In One, Tablet): UEFI must display the Pre-OS screen only on the integrated display </p>
          <p>System without an Integrated display (integrated display is shut or desktop system): UEFI must display the Pre-OS screen on one display. UEFI must select the display by prioritizing the displays based on connector type. The prioritization is as follows: DisplayPort, HDMI, DVI, HD15, Component, S-Video. If there are multiple monitors connected using the same connector type, the firmware can select which one to use. </p>
          <p>Mode Selection</p>
          <p>Once UEFI has determined which display to enabled to display the Pre-OS screen, it must select the mode to apply based on the following logic</p>
          <p>System with an Integrated display(Laptop, All In One, Tablet): The display must always be set to its native resolution and native timing</p>
          <p>System without an Integrated display (desktop): </p>
          <p>UEFI must attempt to set the native resolution and timing of the display by obtaining it from the EDID.</p>
          <p>If that is not supported, UEFI must select an alternate mode that matches the same aspect ratio as the native resolution of the display. </p>
          <p>At the minimum, UEFI must set a mode of 1024 x 768</p>
          <p>If the display device does not provide an EDID, UEFI must set a mode of 1024 x 768</p>
          <p>The firmware must always use a 32 bit linear frame buffer to display the Pre-OS screen</p>
          <p>PixelsPerScanLine must be equal to the HorizontalResolution.</p>
          <p>PixelFormat must be PixelBlueGreenRedReserved8BitPerColor. Note that a physical frame buffer is required; PixelBltOnly is not supported.  </p>
          <p>Mode Pruning</p>
          <p>UEFI must prune the list of available modes in accordance with the requirements called out in EFI_GRAPHICS_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL.QueryMode()  (as specified in the UEFI specification version 2.1)</p>
          <p>Providing the EDID</p>
          <p>Once the UEFI has set a mode on the appropriate display (based on Topology Selection), UEFI must obtain the EDID of the display and pass it to Windows when Windows uses the  EFI_EDID_DISCOVERED_PROTOCOL (as specified in the UEFI specification version 2.1 )to query for the EDID. </p>
          <p>It is possible that some integrated panels might not have an EDID in the display panel itself.  In this case, UEFI must manufacture the EDID. The EDID must accurately specify the native timing and the physical dimensions of the integrated panel</p>
          <p>If the display is not integrated and does not have an EDID, then the UEFI does not need to manufacture an EDID</p>
          <p> </p>

              <td>
                <p>Modern boot experience requires a pre-boot environment which is both fast and visually appealing. The system UEFI controls the display before Windows takes over the control. This means that the screen controlled by the firmware is the first thing that the user sees. Therefore, it is very important that the user has a great user experience at this stage. Some of the key goals are: Ensure that the screen is visible on exactly one display. Display on a single screen ensures that it is easy for the firmware to set a timing and that the UI is not scaled to fit multiple displays of different sizes and aspect ratios. It is easier for the firmware to display on one display instead of many. The native resolution is important in a number of Windows scenarios: Native resolution provides the sharpest and most clear text. Booting the system in native resolution eliminates the need to change modes during the boot process. The frame buffer can be handed off between bios, boot loader, OS boot, and display driver. The result of this is that the display does not flash during boot and gives a more seamless boot experience. Providing the EDID to Windows is important so that Windows can determine the physical dimensions of the display. Windows will automatically scale its UI to be large on high DPI displays so that the text is large enough for the user to see.</p>

For a detailed description of each, refer to the WDDM 1.2 specification or the Windows 8 WDDM 1.2 requirement Device.Graphics.WDDM12.Base.Each of these driver/device types are designed for specific scenarios and usage case. All client scenarios expect a "full" graphics device. Also many applications assume that the post device is the "best" graphics devices and use that device exclusively. For this reason, a Windows client system must have a "full" graphics driver/device that is capable of display, rendering, and video.</p>

          <p>The Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) was introduced with Windows Vista as a replacement to the Windows XP Display Driver Model (XDDM). The WDDM architecture offers functionality to enable features such as desktop composition, enhanced fault Tolerance, video memory manager, scheduler, cross process sharing of D3D surfaces and so on. WDDM was specifically designed for modern graphics devices that are a minimum of Direct3D 10 Feature Level 9_3 with pixel shader 2.0 or better and have all the necessary hardware features to support the WDDM functionality of memory management, scheduling, and fault tolerance. WDDM for Windows Vista was referred to as "WDDM v1.0".  WDDM 1.0 is required for Windows Vista.Windows 7 made incremental changes to the driver model for supporting Windows 7 features and capabilities and is referred to as "WDDM v1.1" and is a strict superset of WDDM 1.0.  WDDM v1.1 introduces support for D3D11, GDI hardware acceleration, Connecting and Configuring Displays, DXVA HD, and other features. WDDM 1.1 is required for Windows 7.Windows 8 also introduces features and capabilities that require graphics driver changes. These incremental changes range from small changes such as smooth rotation, to large changes such as 3D stereo, and D3D11 video support. The WDDM driver model that provides these Windows 8 features is referred to as "WDDM v1.2." WDDM v1.2 is a superset of WDDM 1.1, and WDDM 1.0. WDDM v1.2 is required by all systems shipped with Windows 8. WDDM 1.0 and WDDM 1.1 will only be supported with legacy devices on legacy systems. The best experience and Windows 8 specific features are only enabled by a WDDM 1.2 driver. A WDDM driver that implements some WDDM 1.2 required features, but not all required features will fail to load on Windows 8.For Windows 8 XDDM is officially retired and XDDM drivers will no longer load on Windows 8 Client or Server. </p>
          <p>Windows 8.1 introduces features and capabilities that require graphic driver changes. WDDMv1.3 brings significant improvement in areas related to performance, power and reliability for Windows. </p>
          <p>WDDMv1.3 is required by all systems shipped with Windows 8.1. </p>
          <p>Below is a summary these WDDM versions:</p>

          <p> WDDM v1.2 also introduces new types of graphics drivers, targeting specific scenarios and is described below:</p>
          <p>WDDM Full Graphics Driver: This is the full version of the WDDM graphics driver that supports hardware accelerated 2D &amp; 3D operations. This driver is fully capable of handling all the render, display and video functions. WDDM 1.0 and WDDM 1.1 are full graphics drivers. All Windows 8 client systems must have a full graphics WDDM 1.2 device as the primary boot device.</p>
          <p>WDDM Display Only Driver: This driver is only supported as a WDDM 1.2 driver and enables IHVs to write a WDDM based kernel mode driver that is capable of driving display only devices. The OS handles the 2D or 3D rendering using a software simulated GPU. Display only devices are only allowed on client systems within a virtual machine session.</p>
          <p>WDDM Render Only Driver: This driver is only supported as a WDDM 1.2 driver and enables IHVs to write a WDDM driver that supports only rendering functionality. Render only devices are not allowed as the primary graphics device on client systems.</p>
          <p>Table below explains the scenario usage for the new driver types:</p>

          <p>A WDDM driver is required to enumerate source modes for the integrated display. The WDDM driver must support rotated modes (0,90,180 and 270) for every mode that it enumerates for the integrated panel. </p>
          <p>The rotation is required to be supported even if the integrated panel is in a duplicate or extended topology with another display device. For duplicate mode, it is acceptable to rotate all targets connected to the rotated source. Per path rotation is allowed but not required.</p>

                <p>1.The client is sending an HD video stream and a low resolution video stream to two different receiving endpoints and at the same time is receiving two video streams. This requirement will ensure that there aren’t any noticeable glitches in the video</p>
                <p>2.The second requirement covers larger video conferences where there are multiple receivers which all request different resolutions or all have very different downlink speeds and thus require the sender to send out multiple video streams (e.g. 540p, 360p, 240p). Note that on purpose the resolution 720p is not included here as the macro-block processing rate of the encoder should not be exceeded. If then yet another video stream is needed then the application can use a software encoder to generate the fourth stream. On the receiving side again the requirement is due to multiple videos being shown in the Lync client.</p>
                <p>3.In video conference calls the requests of the receiving clients can change significantly during the call e.g. if the video window of the client UI changes in size and thus requires a different resolution, if the bandwidth changes significantly e.g. by adding desktop sharing modality, if client leave or join the conference. To ensure that the encoder/decoder handles these dynamic changes the third requirement will test dynamic configuration changes.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>Computers must appear as a single object in the Devices and Printers folder. Windows 7 and newer has a platform layer which groups all functionality exposed by the computer into a single object. This object is referred to as the computer device container. The computer device container must contain all of the device functions that are located physically inside the computer chassis. This includes, but is not limited to, keyboards, touch-pads; media control/media transport keys, wireless radios, storage devices, and audio devices. The computer device container is used throughout the Windows platform and is visibly exposed to the user in the Devices and Printers user interface. This requirement ensures a consistent and high quality user experience by enforcing the "one object per physical device" rule in the Devices and Printers folder.The computer must appear as a single device container in the Devices and Printers folder for the following reason: </p>
          <p>Devices and Printers will be unable to provide a logical and understandable representation of the computer to the user. Accurate information as to which devices are physically integrated with the computer must be supplied to support this and dependent Windows features.</p>
          <p>Design Notes:Windows is moving towards a device centric presentation of computers and devices. The Devices and Printers folder will show the computer and all devices that are connected to the computer. In Devices and Printers the computer is represented by a single icon. All of the functionality exposed by the computer will be available through this single icon object, providing one location for users to discover devices integrated with the computer and execute specific actions on those integrated devices. To enable this experience, the computer must be able to detect and group all computer integrated devices. (I.e. all devices physically inside the PC.) This requires that computer integrated devices properly identify themselves as integrated components. This can be achieved by indicating that the device is not removable from computer, properly configuring ACPI for the port to which the device is attached, or creating a registry DeviceOverride entry for the device. (Note: Each bus type has different mechanisms for identifying the removable relationship for devices attached to that bus. Refer to the "Multifunction Device Support and Device Container Groupings in Windows 7" whitepaper for details.)To group the functionality exposed by the computer into a single device container, Windows uses information available in the device hardware, bus driver, and system UEFI or BIOS and Windows registry. The bus type to which a given device is attached determines the heuristic Windows applies to group that device.  The whitepaper titled "Multifunction Device Support and Device Container Groupings in Windows 7," which can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/Device/DeviceExperience/ContainerIDs.mspx, explains the heuristic for many bus types, including: </p>
          <p>Universal Serial Bus (USB) </p>
          <p>Bluetooth </p>
          <p>IP connected devices using Plug and Play Extensions (PnP-X) </p>
          <p>1394 </p>
          <p>eSATA </p>
          <p>PCI Express (PCIe)</p>
          <p>The Single Computer Display Object test (ComputerSingleDDOTest.exe) must be executed on the system to check if this requirement has been met. The tool is available in Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK). The computer configuration for this test is different for laptops and desktop computers: </p>
          <p>Laptops: No external devices (other than a monitor) can be attached to the laptop when the ComputerSingleDDOTest.exe is run. If external devices of any type are attached the test will fail automatically. </p>
          <p>Desktops (computers which require an external keyboard, mouse and monitor to be attached): Only a keyboard, mouse and monitor can be attached to the desktop when the ComputerSingleDDOTest.exe is run. If any devices other than these are attached the test will fail automatically.</p>
          <p>The ComputerSingleDDOTest.exe will identify those devices which Windows was unable to group with the computer device container. Determine the bus to which the indicated device is attached and follow the details in the whitepaper to determine why the device was not correctly grouped with the computer.The design changes required to group an internal device with the computer device container vary depending on the bus to which the device is attached. Refer to the "Multifunction Device Support and Device Container Groupings in Windows 7" whitepaper for details.Testing Notes:This requirement can be tested by using the Single Computer Display Object Test (ComputerSingleDDOTest.exe) in the WLK. The computer configuration for this test is different for laptops and desktop computers:</p>
          <p>Laptops: No external devices can be attached to the laptop when the ComputerSingleDDOTest.exe is run. If external devices of any type are attached the test will fail automatically. </p>
          <p>Desktops (computers which require an external keyboard, mouse and monitor to be attached): Only a keyboard, mouse and monitor can be attached to the desktop when the ComputerSingleDDOTest.exe is run. If any devices other than these are attached the test will fail automatically. </p>
          <p>The following are examples of the output from the Single Computer Display Object Test, showing both an unsuccessful and successful test pass. Both were executed on the same laptop computer. There were not any devices attached to the laptop at the time the test was executed.Unsuccessful test result:In the failure case, the laptop has two USB devices which are detected as separate device containers from the computer device container. These two devices are actually internal to the computer and connected to an internal USB hub.D:\Tools\ComputerSingleDDOTest&gt;ComputerSingleDDOTest.exe -laptopStart: SystemFund-0200: Computers must be represented by one icon in Device Center., TUID=0E7AEA02-2712-422F-A9CD-FFBE470FD391Found Device "USB Input Device". - This device should be part of the computer.Found Device "USB Composite Device". - This device should be part of the computer.Error: 0x0, Error 0x00000000        FAIL: Devices were found that are part of the computer but were reported as removable from the computer.        File=__FILE__ Line=468End: Fail, SystemFund-0200: Computers must be represented by one icon in DeviceCenter., TUID=0E7AEA02-2712-422F-A9CD-FFBE470FD391, Repro= D:\Tools\ComputerSingleDDOTest \ComputerSingleDDOTest.exeSummary: Total=1, Passed=0, Failed=1, Blocked=0, Warned=0, Skipped=0Successful test result:This is the same laptop as the unsuccessful test result above.

          <p>When there is a hardware button for wireless radios there must not be more than one, and it must control all the radios present in the computer.An LED to indicate the state of the switch is optional. Please note that an LED indicating wireless status is not allowed on systems that support connected standby. If an LED is present along with the button, it must behave as defined below. </p>
          <p>There must only be one LED to indicate wireless status (i.e. there must be not one LED for Bluetooth, one for Wi-Fi, etc.).</p>
          <p>If the global wireless state is ON, the LED must be lit.</p>

Reporting the state of the A-B switch when the computer is turned back on is especially important in the case that the switch changed states while the PC was in states S3/S4/S5. </p>

          <p>Proximity-type radios such as NFC and TransferJet</p>
          <p>Bluetooth radio that doesn't use the Windows Native Bluetooth stack </p>
          <p>Each radio that does not have an inbox radio manager must have its own IRadioInstance object and be enumerable from IMediaRadioManager::IEnumRadioInstance. There is inbox support for WLAN, mobile broadband and Bluetooth.</p>
          <p>Verify IRadioInstance::GetRadioManagerSignature returns the media radio manager GUID.</p>
          <p>RadioInstance::GetInstanceSignature must return device instance path.</p>
          <p>The radio COM object manager must send and consume On and Off calls from the Radio Management API. </p>
          <p>When the Airplane Mode switch is turned ON by the user, the Radio Management API calls the method OnSystemRadioStateChange(), with the sysRadioState parameter equal to SRS_RADIO_DISABLED, in which case the Media Radio Manager must record the current device radio state for later use and must set the radio state to DEVICE_SW_RADIO_OFF. </p>
          <p>When the Airplane Mode switch is turned OFF by the user, the Radio Management API calls the method OnSystemRadioStateChange(), with the sysRadioState parameter equal to SRS_RADIO_ENABLED, in which case the device radio associated with the radio instance managed by this Media Radio Manager must transition to a previous device radio state (the last recorded state).</p>
          <p>Radio COM object manager must report radio instance within 100 milliseconds. Please note that this does not mean that radio COM object manager has to be fully functional (ready to turning radio on/off); it just means that radio COM object manager needs to report the presence of a radio within 100 milliseconds.</p>
          <p>Users do NOT need administrator privileges to change the radio state. Any standard user must be able to change the radio state.</p>
          <p>Radio COM object manager must be able to change the state of the radio (on to off, or off to on) within 5 seconds.</p>

          <p>Required Static Properties </p>
          <p>The following properties must not change value over time, so that the Sensor and Location Platform (and applications) can use them to select and manage sensors. These properties are queried using Device Driver Interfaces ISensorDriver::OnGetSupportedProperties() and ISensorDriver::OnGetProperties(). </p>
          <p>Data types for these properties must match those in the following chart. </p>
          <p>The properties must be implemented following the guidelines described in MSDN.</p>
          <p>Settable Properties </p>
          <p>Applications can use settable properties to configure the driver (such as optimize for power or other factors). Other settable properties can be exposed besides the following ones, but if this property is exposed, it must be settable. </p>
          <p>Setting SENSOR_PROPERTY_CURRENT_REPORT_INTERVAL &lt; SENSOR_PROPERTY_MIN_REPORT_INTERVAL does not change the current report interval and setting SENSOR_PROPERTY_CHANGE_SENSITIVITY &lt; 0 does not change the change sensitivity.The sensor shall be able to handle changes to the current report interval and change sensitivity for a single and multiple clients.</p>
          <p> The sensor should be able to respond to a client asking to be removed from calculation of the effective current report interval and change sensitivity. Clients can set CS to VT_NULL but there isn’t an API to be removed. CRI/CS set by multiple clients needs to respect that most sensitive request. Sensors shall follow the current report interval and change sensitivity (when applicable) documentation found on MSDN:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh706201(v=vs.85).aspx</p>
          <p>GPS devices shall support property value for SENSOR_PROPERTY_MIN_REPORT_INTERVAL at one second or less and be capable of sending events at this interval.</p>
          <p>Sensor drivers and firmware must support and adhere to the following Settable Properties: in the Sensor API.</p>

          <p>The device driver must correctly handle queries and sets for properties that a sensor device does not support. This enables the Sensor and Location Platform to correctly notify applications when sensor properties are missing.</p>
          <p>Drivers must return S_FALSE from Device Driver Interfaces ISensorDriver::OnGetProperties and ISensorDriver::OnSetProperties if one or more of the requested properties is not present on the device.</p>
          <p>For each missing property the PropVariant for the requested property must have a type of VT_ERROR and a value of HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_NOT_FOUND). The driver can return valid values for properties it does have alongside not-valid values.</p>

          <p>Reliability </p>
          <p>The driver must continue to operate after four hours of reporting data and "get data", "get property" calls.</p>

          <p>Timestamp </p>
          <p>The driver must report an accurate relative timestamp with each report.The timestamp shall be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. This timestamp must be greater than the initial prompt to provide a timestamp and must be less than or equal to the time the event is received.</p>
          <p>Ready State Validation </p>
          <p>Sensors shall not transition to the SENSOR_STATE_READY state until valid data is available.</p>
          <p>Sensors must complete power-up initialization tasks and transition to the SENSOR_STATE_READY after being opened by a client or resuming from system standby within the following times: </p>

          <p>A Windows 7 or Windows 8 system shipped in legacy BIOS mode and Master Boot Record (MBR) configured must ship with a type 0x7 or type 0x27, active system partition in addition to the operating system partition (configured as Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, etc.). This active system partition must be at least 100MB in size for Windows 7 systems. For Windows 8 systems, this active system partition must have at least 250MB of free space, above and beyond any space used by required files. For Windows 7 systems, we similarly recommend that the active partition have at least 250MB of free space for future upgrade to a new version of Windows. This additional system partition can be used to host Windows Recovery Environment (RE) and OEM tools (provided by the OEM), so long as the partition still meets the 250MB free space requirement.  Implementation of this partition allows support of current and future Windows features such as BitLocker, and simplifies configuration and deployments.Tools and documentation to implement split-loader configuration can be found in Windows OEM Preinstallation Kit/Automated Installation Kit (OPK/AIK).</p>

          <strong>Windows Button</strong>

The Windows button can only send the Windows key scan code.  The Windows logo that goes on the button, orientation and style guide are documented in the Logo License Agreement.</p>
        <p>For tablets and convertibles of all screen sizes, the Windows button can be placed anywhere on the tablet. The design should consider convenient placement for left and right-handed users.  Swiping across the button must not interfere with Windows gestures.  </p>
        <p>If the tablet is in a docking station with a keyboard, it is acceptable that the Windows button is covered by the docking station.  </p>
        <p>If the system is a convertible, the buttons must be accessible in all configurations. </p>
        <p>The Windows button toggles between the last app and the Start Screen.</p>
        <p>The preference is that the Windows button must be a soft press or mechanical button type.  It is acceptable to implement a capacitive button.  </p>

          <p>For any camera device that is built into the chassis of the system and has mechanically fixed direction, the firmware must provide the _PLD method and set the panel field (bits[69:67]) to the appropriate value for the panel on which the camera is mounted.  For example, "Front" indicates the camera view the user (webcam), while "back" indicates that the camera views away from the end user (still or video camera).In addition, bit 143:128 (Vertical Offset), and bits 159:144 (Horizontal Offset) must provide the relative location of the camera with respect to the display. This origin is relative to the native pixel addressing in the display component. The origin is the lower left hand corner of the display, where positive Horizontal and Vertical Offset values are to the right and up, respectively.  For more information see the ACPI version 5.0 Section 6.1.8 "Device Configuration _PLD (Physical Device Location)".All other fields in the _PLD are optional.</p>

          <p>Scenarios </p>
          <p>Previewing through the camera locally (viewfinder)</p>
          <p>Taking a photo</p>
          <p>Recording a video</p>
          <p>Real-time Communication</p>
          <p>This requirement applies to systems with non-USB built-in cameras. </p>
          <p>Driver Model </p>
          <p>A camera driver must be provided. AVStream is the required driver model.</p>
          <p>AVStream driver is recommended to be a child driver of the WDDM driver. (IHV graphics driver must report the child slot as a child of the graphics device in DxgkDdiQueryChildRelations with correct AcpiUid. Later IHV driver should report the correct connect status in DxgkDdiQueryChildStatus.</p>
          <p>AVStream Camera Driver shall be installed through device driver which meets the Windows security requirement. The driver shall not crash or hang the OS, and shall disallow memory violations. </p>
          <p>Driver shall support system memory.</p>
          <p>Pins </p>
          <p>The driver is required to expose the following pins types:</p>
          <p>Capture: Supporting PINNAME_VIDEO_CAPTURE pin category with NV12 format</p>
          <p>Image: Supporting PINNAME_IMAGE pin category with JPEG format (can be supported by IHV Plug-in Model) and an uncompressed format (at least one of the following uncompressed formats: RGB32 or NV12 – support for both formats are recommended for all resolutions). In addition, image pin must support software trigger, VideoControlFlag_Trigger.</p>
          <p>Optionally, the driver may expose:</p>
          <p>Preview:  Supporting PINNAME_VIDEO_PREVIEW pin category with NV12 format. (This is the video streaming pin with lower priority and potentially lower resolution)</p>
          <p>All of the pins must be able to operate both independently and in combination without interfering with each other. </p>
          <p>All streaming pins must support progressive format. The driver should set the interlace flag on the media type and the sample correctly.</p>
          <p>Performance </p>
          <p>Recorded content using all media types exposed by the record pin must be glitch free. Glitch is defined as a discontinuity in the stream that exceeds +/- half of a single frame duration between frames at light conditions sufficient to achieve the maximum frame rate. </p>
          <p>Overall CPU usage during frame capture due to ISP processing must be &lt;=5 % and CPU processing delays must be &lt;=5ms using all media types exposed, while streaming from the record and preview pins concurrently. CPU usage associated with previewing and encoding frames is excluded from this calculation.</p>
          <p>Time to capture and deliver first photo or video frame is &lt;= 500 ms at light conditions sufficient to achieve the maximum frame rate, where the resolution is the lesser of the maximum resolution exposed by the image pin or 8MP.</p>
          <p>Controls </p>
          <p>If camera supports any of the following control, it must expose the capability through the associated property in Windows</p>
          <p>Basic Controls (synchronous)</p>
          <p>Brightness</p>
          <p>Contrast</p>
          <p>Hue</p>
          <p>White Balance</p>
          <p>Backlight Compensation</p>
          <p>Exposure Focus</p>
          <p>Zoom</p>
          <p>Extended Controls </p>
          <p>Extended Focus</p>
          <p>Photo Mode (async)</p>
          <p>Single Frame HDR</p>
          <p>Photo Sequence</p>
          <p>Normal</p>

          <p>Warm Start</p>
          <p>EV Compensation</p>
          <p>Trigger Time</p>
          <p>Thumbnails</p>
          <p>Camera Angle Offset</p>
          <p>Video Stabilization </p>
          <p>If available, latency due to Image Stabilization shall not be more than one frame buffering in the “low” setting, default should be off and should be controllable at the application level</p>
          <p>Mirroring </p>
          <p>The default state for mirroring must be "not mirrored".</p>
          <p>Photo Sequence</p>
          <p>If camera HW supports Photo Sequence, it must expose the capability through the  Photo Mode property and comply with the performance requirements</p>
          <p>Lag between the user take photo request and when the actual sampled frame being captured must be less than 150ms at light conditions sufficient to achieve the maximum frame rate. The latency is defined between that time when the photo is triggered and the sample to be delivered to the pipeline is captured.</p>
          <p>Photo Sequence must support the same resolutions that are exposed in Normal mode.</p>
          <p>Device must report the current frame rates possible in Photo Sequence Mode based on the current light conditions. Device must honor and not exceed the maximum frame rate set by the application. </p>
          <p>Device must support at minimum 8fps measured at lesser of the maximum resolution exposed by the image pin or 8MP.</p>
          <p>Extra system wide CPU load in this mode shall not be more than 10% of the Normal Photo mode. Extra overall system power usage due this mode shall not be more than 10% of the Normal Photo mode when using the largest available preview format at 30fps.</p>
          <p>ISP and image encode processing must not exceed 50ms per frame at lesser of the maximum resolution exposed by the image pin or 8MP.</p>
          <p>Driver must be able to provide at least 8 frames in the past at lesser of the maximum resolution exposed by the image pin or 8MP.</p>
          <p>Driver must be able to provide frames continuously in Photo Sequence mode at lesser of the maximum resolution exposed by the image pin or 8MP.</p>
          <p>The JPEG image generated by the camera may optionally have EXIF metadata indicating the “flash fired” information. EXIF information shall not include personally identifiable information, such as location, unique ids, among others.</p>
          <p>Device must support thumbnails, upon request, at 1/2x, 1/4x, 1/8x, and 1/16x of the width and height of the original image resolution.</p>
          <p>Photo Sequence should be performed independently, regardless preview on/off.</p>

          <p>The next version of Windows will support several different debug transports. They are listed below in the preferred order of implementation. Hardware Debugging Transports </p>
          <p>Ethernet Network Interface Card from the supported list: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh830880</p>
          <p>USB 3.0 - xHCI controller compliant to xHCI debug specification. </p>
          <p>1394 OHCI compliant Firewire controllers.</p>
          <p>USB2 OTG (on supported hardware for Windows, recommend XHCI debug instead).</p>
          <p>USB 2.0 EHCI debug (the debug enabled port must be user accessible). </p>
          <p>Legacy Serial (16550 compatible programming interface).</p>
          <p> ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTSFOR ALL OF THE ABOVE IMPLEMENTATIONS THE FOLLOWING MUST APPLY: </p>
          <p>There must be at least one user accessible debug port on the machine. t is acceptable for the system to require a separate debugging board that provides the transports listed above.</p>
          <p>On retail PC platforms, it is strongly recommended that machines have 2 user accessible debug ports from the above list. The secondary debug port is required to debug scenarios where the first debug port is in use as part of the scenario. Microsoft is not responsible for debugging or servicing issues which cannot be debugged on the retail platform, or reproduced on development platforms. </p>
          <p>SoC development or prototype platforms provided to Microsoft for evaluation must have a dedicated debug port available for debugging. If the debug port is used for any scenarios that are expected to also be used on retail shipping devices, in that case, there must be a secondary debug port available for debugging. This is to ensure that SoC development platforms can be used to test and debug all scenarios for all available transports, including USB host and function. </p>
          <p>All debug device registers must be memory or I/O mapped. For example, the debug device must not be connected behind a shared bus such as SPI or I2C. This would prevent other devices on the same bus from being debugged.</p>
          <p>When enabled, the debug device shall be powered and clocked by the UEFI firmware during preboot, before transferring control to the boot block. </p>

          <p> DSDT Requirements As per ACPI 4.0a, all devices in the ACPI namespace must include:  </p>
          <p>A vendor-assigned, ACPI-compliant Hardware ID (_HID object). </p>
          <p>A set of resources consumed (_CRS object). </p>
          <p>In addition, the following conditional requirements apply:  </p>
          <p>If any devices in the namespace share the same Hardware ID, then each is required to have a distinct Unique Identifier (_UID object). </p>
          <p>If any device in the namespace is enumerated by its parent bus (Plug and Play buses), the address of the device on its parent bus (_ADR object) is required. </p>
          <p>If any device in the namespace is compatible with a Microsoft-provided driver, the Compatible ID (_CID object) defined for that device type is required. </p>
          <p>General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) on an System that Supports Connected StandbyGPIO Controllers for pins used by Windows drivers or ASL control methods must appear as devices in the ACPI namespace. Devices in the namespace that are connected to GPIO pins on an enumerated controller device must:  </p>
          <p>Include GPIO IO Connection resource descriptors in their _CRS for any GPIO I/O pins connected.  Include GPIO Interrupt Connection resource descriptors in their _CRS object for any GPIO interrupt pins connected. </p>
          <p>Simple Peripheral Bus (SPB) on an System that supports Connected StandbySPB Controllers for connections used by Windows drivers or ASL control methods must appear as devices in the ACPI namespace. Devices in the namespace that are connected to an enumerated SPB controller device (UART, I2C, SPI) must include SPB Connection resource descriptors in their _CRS for the SPB Connection(s) used. Power Button The power button, whether implemented as an ACPI Control Method Power Button or as part of the Windows-compatible Button Array, must:  </p>
          <p>Be able to cause the system to power-up when required. </p>
          <p>Generate the Power Button Override Event (Section 4.7.2.2.1.3 of the ACPI 4.0a specification) when held down for 4 seconds. </p>
          <p>Control Method Power Button Systems dependent on built-in (or connected) keyboards/mice for input must conform to the ACPI Control Method Power Button (Section 4.7.2.2.1.2 of the ACPI 4.0a Specification).  In addition, systems that support connected standby must:  </p>
          <p>Implement the ACPI Control Method Power Button (Section 4.7.2.2.1.2 of the ACPI 4.0a Specification) using a dedicated GPIO interrupt pin to signal button press events. </p>
          <p>Configure the power button's GPIO interrupt pin as a non-shared, wake-capable (ExclusiveAndWake) GPIO interrupt connection resource. </p>
          <p>List the Power Button's GPIO interrupt connection resource in the ACPI Event Information (_AEI object) of the GPIO controller device to which it is connected. </p>
          <p>Provide the event method (_Lxx or _Exx object) for the power button event under the GPIO controller device in the ACPI namespace. </p>
          <p>NOTE: For systems that require a separate driver to handle power button presses, it is acceptable to have that driver evaluate a control method that performs a Notify() on the Control Method Power Button device instead of using the GPIO-based solution above. Button Array-based Power Button Touch-first (keyboard-less) systems must:  </p>
          <p>Implement the Windows-compatible Button Array device. </p>
          <p>Connect the power button to a dedicated GPIO interrupt pin. </p>
          <p>Configure the power button's GPIO interrupt pin as a non-shared, wake-capable (ExclusiveAndWake), Edge-triggered (Edge) GPIO interrupt connection resource, capable of interrupting on both edges (ActiveBoth). </p>
          <p>List the power button's GPIO Interrupt connection resource first in the Button Array device's _CRS object. </p>
          <p>NOTE: For systems that require a separate driver to handle power button presses, it is acceptable to have that driver call the 5-Button array driver's power button event interface instead of using the GPIO-based solution above. Time and Alarm Device All battery-powered systems which are not capable of supporting Connected Standby are required to implement the Alarm capabilities of the ACPI Time and Alarm control method device. Any system that supports Connected Standby that sets the "CMOS RTC Not Present" bit in the IAPC_BOOT_ARCH flags field of the FADT must implement the device's Time capabilities.  </p>

          <p>This requirement limits the amount of memory that is reserved by the hardware (including drivers or firmware) and not available to the OS or user applications on a system.  Taking into consideration the changes required to meet this requirement, it will be introduced in a phased manner. During the 2013 timeframe, the following interim thresholds will apply</p>
          <p>&lt;=2GB systems – max  of 3% of 2GB (61.5MB)</p>
          <p>2-3GB systems – max of 3% of 3GB (92.2MB)</p>
          <p>For all other systems, a max of 120MB</p>
          <p>If screen resolution exceeds 1366x768, an additional 8 bytes per pixel will be allowed. Note: The budgets above are intended to cover 2 full screen video memory reservations for graphics drivers at 1366x768 at 32 bytes per pixel – 8MB. The adjustment above takes into consideration machines with higher resolutions.</p>

          <p>UEFI systems must allow the Operating System to create both generic and device specific boot entries with Messaging Device path, specifically USB Class Device Path (UEFI version 2.3 main specification section 9.3.5.9). The firmware must respect these settings and not modify them once the OS has changed them. Furthermore, the firmware must accurately report the boot entries to the OS. Functional Notes:If the device corresponding to a boot entry is not found, it is preferable for the system to proceed to the next boot entry silently (i.e. without presenting an error message or requiring user intervention).If the system is booted from an internal USB device and there is a USB class entry at the top of the boot order, the system should first attempt to boot from external USB devices before attempting internal USB boot devices.Design Notes:The UEFI specification requires that the software bootmanager be allowed to do the boot order programming (UEFI v. 2.3 Section 3.1.1 "Boot Manager Programming").The firmware should interpret load options and device paths as specified in Section 9 "Protocols - Device Path Protocol".The UEFI specification describes the variables that must be modifiable at runtime in Section 3.2, table 10.The UEFI specification is available at http://www.UEFI.org.   This requirement is "If Implemented" for Server systems and applies only if a Server system is UEFI capable</p>

If a system is available with 32bit and/or 64bit UEFI, both configurations must be tested for certification. For server, certification in UEFI mode is only required if UEFI is implemented.OEMs may ship with CSM mode activated and the enterprise or government customer's licensed OS selection when requested.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>Note: These requirements are "If Implemented" for Server systems and apply only if a Server system supports UEFI Secure Boot.</p>
          <p>For the purposes of UEFI Secure Boot, the platform shall expose an interface to Secure Boot, whereby the system firmware is compliant with the following sections and sub-sections of UEFI version 2.3.1 Errata C:</p>
          <p>7.1</p>
          <p>7.2</p>
          <p>7.2.1</p>
          <p>27.2</p>
          <p>27.5 - 27.8 (as further profiled below).</p>
          <p>Secure Boot must ship enabled Configure UEFI Version 2.3.1 Errata C variables SecureBoot=1 and SetupMode=0 with a signature database (EFI_IMAGE_SECURITY_DATABASE) necessary to boot the machine securely pre-provisioned, and include a PK that is set and a valid KEK database. The system uses this database to verify that only trusted code (for example: trusted signed boot loader) is initialized, and that any unsigned image or an image that is signed by an unauthorized publisher does not execute. The contents of the signature database is determined by the OEM, based on the required native and third-party UEFI drivers, respective recovery needs, and the OS Boot Loader installed on the machine. The following Microsoft-provided EFI_CERT_X509 signature shall be included in the signature database: "CN=Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011" and "Cert Hash(sha1): 58 0a 6f 4c c4 e4 b6 69 b9 eb dc 1b 2b 3e 08 7b 80 d0 67 8d" which shall use the following SignatureOwner GUID: {77fa9abd-0359-4d32-bd60-28f4e78f784b}, must also be included in the form of either an EFI_CERT_X509_GUID or EFI_CERT_RSA2048_GUID type.</p>
          <p>Note: Must NOT contain the following certificate: "CN=Microsoft Windows PCA 2010" and "Cert Hash(sha1): c0 13 86 a9 07 49 64 04 f2 76 c3 c1 85 3a bf 4a 52 74 af 88"</p>
          <p>Note II: Windows Server systems may ship with Secure Boot disabled, but all other provisions of this sub-requirement must be met</p>
          <p>When Secure Boot is Enabled, Compatibility Support Modules (CSM) must NOT be loaded. Compatibility Support Modules are always prohibited on Connected Standby systems.</p>
          <p>The initial UEFI signature databases (db) shall be created with the EFI_VARIABLE_TIME_BASED_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS attribute stored in firmware flash and may be updated only with an OEM-signed firmware update or through UEFI authenticated variable write.</p>
          <p>Support for the UEFI "forbidden" signature database (EFI_IMAGE_SECURITY_DATABASE1) must be implemented.</p>
          <p>The platform shall ship with an initial, possibly empty, "forbidden" signature database (EFI_IMAGE_SECURITY_DATABASE1) created with the EFI_VARIABLE_TIME_BASED_AUTHENTICATED_ACCESS attribute. When a signature is added to the forbidden signature database, upon reboot, any image certified with that signature must not be allowed to initialize/execute.</p>
          <p>Secure Boot must be rooted in a protected or ROM-based Public Key. Secure Boot must be rooted in an RSA public key with a modulus size of at least 2048 bits, and either be based in unalterable ROM or otherwise protected from alteration by a secure firmware update process, as defined below.</p>
          <p>Secure firmware update process. If the platform firmware is to be serviced, it must follow a secure update process. To ensure the lowest level code layer is not compromised, the platform must support a secure firmware update process that ensures only signed firmware components that can be verified using the signature database (and are not invalidated by the forbidden signature database) can be installed. UEFI Boot Services variables must be hardware-protected and preserved across flash updates. The Flash ROM that stores the UEFI BIOS code must be protected. Flash that is typically open at reset (to allow for authenticated firmware updates) must subsequently be locked before running any unauthorized code. The firmware update process must also protect against rolling back to insecure versions, or non-production versions that may disable secure boot or include non-production keys. A physically present user may however override the rollback protection manually. In such a scenario (where the rollback protection is overridden), the TPM must be cleared. Further, it is recommended that manufacturers writing BIOS code adhere to the NIST guidelines set out in NIST SP 800-147 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-147/NIST-SP800-147-April2011.pdf), BIOS Protection Guidelines, which provides guidelines for building features into the BIOS that help protect it from being modified or corrupted by attackers. For example, by using cryptographic digital signatures to authenticate BIOS updates.</p>
          <p>Signed Firmware Code Integrity Check. Firmware that is installed by the OEM and is either read-only or protected by a secure firmware update process, as defined above, may be considered protected. Systems shall verify that all unprotected firmware components, UEFI drivers, and UEFI applications are signed using minimum RSA-2048 with SHA-256 (MD5 and SHA-1 are prohibited), and verify that UEFI applications and drivers that are not signed as per these requirements will fail to run (this is the default policy for acceptable signature algorithms). If an images signature is not found in the authorized database, or is found in the forbidden database, the image must not be started, and instead, information about it shall be placed in the Image Execution Information Table. </p>
          <p>UEFI firmware and driver implementations must be resistant to malicious input from untrusted sources. Incomplete input validation may result in buffer overflows, integer and pointer corruption, memory overwrites, and other vulnerabilities, compromising the runtime integrity of authenticated UEFI components.</p>
          <p>Verify Signature of all Boot Apps and Boot Loaders. Upon power-on, the platform shall start executing boot firmware and use public key cryptography as per algorithm policy to verify the signatures of all images in the boot sequence up-to and including the Windows Boot Manager.</p>
          <p>Microsoft Key Encryption Key (KEK) is provisioned A valid Microsoft-provided KEK is included in the KEK database. Microsoft provides the KEK in the form of either an EFI_CERT_X509_GUID or EFI_CERT_RSA2048_GUID type signature. The Microsoft KEK signature uses the following SignatureOwner GUID: {77fa9abd-0359-4d32-bd60-28f4e78f784b}. </p>
          <p>PKpub verification. The PKpub key is owned by the OEM and stored in firmware flash. The private-key counterpart to PKpub is PKpriv, which controls Secure Boot policy on all OEM-manufactured devices, and its protection and use must be secured against un-authorized use or disclosure. PKpub must exist and the operating system must be able to read the value and verify that it exists with proper key length.</p>
          <p>No in-line mechanism is provided whereby a user can bypass Secure Boot failures and boot anyway Signature verification override during boot when Secure Boot is enabled is not allowed. A physically present user override is not permitted for UEFI images that fail signature verification during boot. If a user wants to boot an image that does not pass signature verification, they must explicitly disable Secure Boot on the target system.</p>
          <p>UEFI Shells and related applications. UEFI Modules that are not required to boot the platform must not be signed by any production certificate stored in "db", as UEFI applications can weaken the security of Secure Boot. For example, this includes and is not limited to UEFI Shells as well as manufacturing, test, debug, RMA, &amp; decommissioning tools. Running these tools and shells must require that a platform administrator disables Secure Boot.</p>
          <p>Secure Boot Variable. The firmware shall implement the SecureBoot variable as documented in Section 3.2 "Globally Defined Variables' of UEFI Specification Version 2.3.1 Errata C"</p>
          <p>On non-ARM systems, the platform MUST implement the ability for a physically present user to select between two Secure Boot modes in firmware setup: "Custom" and "Standard". Custom Mode allows for more flexibility as specified in the following:</p>
          <p>A.It shall be possible for a physically present user to use the Custom Mode firmware setup option to modify the contents of the Secure Boot signature databases and the PK. This may be implemented by simply providing the option to clear all Secure Boot databases (PK, KEK, db, dbx), which puts the system into setup mode.</p>
          <p>B.If the user ends up deleting the PK then, upon exiting the Custom Mode firmware setup, the system is operating in Setup Mode with SecureBoot turned off.</p>
          <p>C.The firmware setup shall indicate if Secure Boot is turned on, and if it is operated in Standard or Custom Mode. The firmware setup must provide an option to return from Custom to Standard Mode which restores the factory defaults. On an ARM system, it is forbidden to enable Custom Mode. Only Standard Mode may be enabled.</p>
          <p>Enable/Disable Secure Boot. On non-ARM systems, it is required to implement the ability to disable Secure Boot via firmware setup. A physically present user must be allowed to disable Secure Boot via firmware setup without possession of PKpriv. A Windows Server may also disable Secure Boot remotely using a strongly authenticated (preferably public-key based) out-of-band management connection, such as to a baseboard management controller or service processor. Programmatic disabling of Secure Boot either during Boot Services or after exiting EFI Boot Services MUST NOT be possible. Disabling Secure Boot must not be possible on ARM systems.</p>
          <p>If the firmware is reset to factory defaults, then any customized Secure Boot variables are also factory reset. If the firmware settings are reset to factory defaults, all custom-set variables shall be erased and the OEM PKpub shall be re-established along with the original, manufacturer-provisioned signature databases.</p>
          <p>OEM mechanism exists to remediate failed EFI boot components up to and including the Windows OS loader (bootmgr.efi). Images in the EFI boot path that fail Secure Boot signature verification MUST not be executed, and the EFI_IMAGE_EXECUTION_INFO_TABLE entry for that component shall be updated with the reason for the failure. The UEFI boot manager shall initiate recovery according to an OEM-specific strategy for all components up to and including Windows bootmgr.efi.</p>
          <p>A working Windows RE image must be present on all Windows 8 client systems The Windows Recovery image must be present in the factory image on every Secure Boot capable system. To support automated recovery and provide a positive user experience on Secure Boot systems, the Windows RE image must be present and enabled by default. As part of the Windows 8 Trusted Boot work enhancements have been made to Windows RE to allow optimized recovery from signature verification failures in Secure Boot. OEMs must include Windows RE as part of their factory image on all Windows 8 client systems.</p>
          <p>Firmware-based backup and restore. If the OEM provides a mechanism to backup boot critical files (for example: EFI drivers and boot applications), it must be in a secure location only accessible and serviceable by firmware. The OEM may provide the capacity via firmware or other backup store to store backup copies of boot critical files and recovery tools. If such a store is implemented, the solution must also have the capability to restore the target files onto the system without the need for external media or user intervention. This is a differentiator for the OEM in failover protection, used if the Windows OS loader (bootmgr.efi) or other boot critical components fail, preventing Windows native recovery solutions to execute.</p>
          <p>Firmware-based backup synchronization. Backup copies of boot critical components (for example: EFI drivers and boot applications) stored in firmware must be serviced in sync with updates to same files on the system If the system has the capability to store a backup copy of the Windows OS loader (bootmgr.efi), and potentially other critical boot components, then the files must be serviced on the same schedule as their counterparts in use on the live system. If the Windows OS loader is updated by Windows Update, then the backup copy of bootmgr.efi stored in firmware must be updated on the next boot.</p>
          <p>All Windows 8 client systems must support a secondary boot path. For all Windows 8 systems configured for Secure Boot, there must be an alternate boot path option that is followed by the firmware in the event that the primary Windows OS loader fails. The second boot path may point either to the default shadow copy installed by Windows to the system backup store (&lt;EFI System Volume&gt;\EFI\Boot\boot&lt;platform&gt;.efi ), or to a copy stored by the OEM firmware-based mechanism. This alternate path could be a file in executable memory, or point to a firmware-based remediation process that rolls a copy out of the OEM predetermined backup store.</p>
          <p>All Windows 8 client systems must support a USB boot path for recovery purposes. For all Windows 8 systems configured for Secure Boot, there is a last resort of booting from USB.</p>
          <p>Supporting GetVariable() for the EFI_IMAGE_SECURITY_DATABASE (both authorized and forbidden signature database) and the SecureBoot variable.</p>
          <p>Supporting SetVariable() for the EFI_IMAGE_SECURITY_DATABASE (both authorized and forbidden signature database), using an authorized KEK for authentication.</p>
          <p>Reserved Memory for Windows Secure Boot UEFI Variables. A total of at least 64 KB of non-volatile NVRAM storage memory must be reserved for NV UEFI variables (authenticated and unauthenticated, BS and RT) used by UEFI Secure Boot and Windows, and the maximum supported variable size must be at least 32kB. There is no maximum NVRAM storage limit.</p>
          <p>During normal firmware updates the following must be preserved:</p>
          <p>The Secure Boot state &amp; configuration (PK, KEK, db, dbx, SetupMode, SecureBoot)</p>
          <p>All UEFI variables with VendorGuid {77fa9abd-0359-4d32-bd60-28f4e78f784b}</p>
          <p>A physically-present user who authenticates to the firmware may change, reset, or delete these values</p>
          <p>The platform shall support EFI variables that are:</p>
          <p>accessible only during the boot services or also accessible in the runtime phase;</p>
          <p>non-volatile; and</p>
          <p>possible to update only after proper authorization, for example, being properly signed.</p>
          <p>The platform must support EFI variables with any valid combination of the following UEFI 2.3.1 variable attributes set:</p>
          <p>Copy</p>
          <p>EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILE</p>
          <p>EFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESS</p>
          <p>EFI_VARIABLE_RUNTIME_ACCESS</p>
          <p>EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS</p>
          <p>EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE</p>
          <p>EFI_VARIABLE_TIME_BASED_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS</p>
          <p>Connected Standby systems must meet all of the requirements cited in both "system.fundamentals.firmware.uefisecureboot" and "system.fundamentals.firmware.uefisecureboot.connectedstandby".</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>Since all components in the boot path as well as many performance-critical OS subsystems will invoke cryptographic functions, run-time performance of these functions is critical. The following requirements have been drafted to help ensure sufficient cryptographic capabilities are in place to meet customer expectations on platform speed and performance</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The platform must meet cryptographic performance requirements as stated in Table 1. The platform may meet these requirements through any combination of hardware or software. The following general remarks apply to all algorithms in Table 1:</p>
          <p>The platform must pass the Windows Hardware Certification Kit test "Storage Performance EMMC" with a "CPU Utilization Percentage" value of less than 20%. "CPU Utilization Percentage" is the average CPU usage over the duration of the test for the entire system under test.</p>
          <p>Target performance must be achieved in a multi-threaded test. The number of threads will be determined by querying the property named L"HardwareThreads" on the BCrypt provider through the CNG BCryptGetProperty interface. The provider is required to return a DWORD value in response. If the provider does not support this property, the test will run single-threaded.</p>
          <p>When cryptographic acceleration engines are used: Due to the overhead involved in dispatching requests to hardware acceleration engines, it is recommended that small requests be handled in software. Similarly, it is recommended that vendors consider using CPU-based cryptography to improve throughput when all cryptographic acceleration engines are fully utilized, idle capacity is available on the CPU, and the device is in a high-performance mode (such as when connected to AC power).</p>
          <p>ARM based platforms must implement the EFI_HASH_PROTOCOL from UEFI Industry Group, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Specification version 2.3.1 Errata B. The EFI_HASH_PROTOCOL implementation must be accessible from Windows pre-Operating System code (i.e. in the Boot Services phase of platform boot). Both the UEFI hash protocols EFI_HASH_ALGORITHM_SHA1_NOPAD_GUID and EFI_HASH_ALGORITHM_SHA256_NOPAD_GUID must be supported, and the implementation must support passing a Message at least 10 Mbytes long (Note: No padding must be applied at any point to the input data). </p>
          <p>To make entropy generation capabilities available to Windows pre-Operating System code, the platform shall support the EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL for pre-Operating System read of at least 256 bits of entropy in a single call (i.e. 256 bits of full entropy from a source with security strength of at least 256 bits). The protocol definition can be found in Microsoft Corporation, "UEFI Entropy-Gathering Protocol,"2.</p>
          <p>All cryptographic capabilities in accordance with Table 1 shall be accessible from the runtime OS in kernel mode, through the interface specified in Microsoft Corporation, "BCrypt Profile for SoC Acceleration," 2 .</p>
          <p>OPTIONAL. It is recommended that the platform's cryptographic capabilities also be accessible from the runtime OS in user mode, through the interface previously referenced in Requirement 4.</p>
          <p>The OS interface library shall be implemented in such a way that when an unprivileged process is operating on a given key in a given context, it shall not be able to access the key material or perform key operations associated with other contexts.</p>
          <p>OPTIONAL. It is highly recommended that the RNG capability of the platform be exposed through an OS entropy source through the interface specified in Microsoft Corporation, "BCrypt Profile for SoC Acceleration," previously referenced in Requirement 4.</p>
          <p>OPTIONAL.  (Applies when a cryptographic acceleration engine is used) It should be possible to maintain and perform cryptographic operations on at least three distinct symmetric keys or two symmetric keys and one asymmetric key simultaneously in the acceleration engine.  </p>
          <p>Table 1: Algorithm-specific requirements. The "Category" column classifies algorithms as mandatory to support at the software interface as per requirement 4 (M), or optional (O). Note that all algorithms that are accelerated in hardware must also be exposed through the software interface.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>Connected-Standby systems must meet all of the requirements cited in this section and under System.Fundamentals.Firmware.Uefisecureboot section.</p>
          <p>Boot Integrity. Platform uses on-die ROM or One-Time Programmable (OTP) memory for storing initial boot code and initial public key (or hash of initial public key) used to provide boot integrity, and provides power-on reset logic to execute from on-die ROM or secure on-die SRAM. </p>
          <p>Secure Boot launch of Windows 8 BootMgr must not require use of an Allowed DB entry other than the Microsoft-provided EFI_CERT_X509 signature with "CN=Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011" and "Cert Hash(sha1): 58 0a 6f 4c c4 e4 b6 69 b9 eb dc 1b 2b 3e 08 7b 80 d0 67 8d. </p>
          <p>On ARM, the UEFI Allowed database ("db") must not contain any other entry than the Microsoft-provided EFI_CERT_X509 signature with "CN=Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011" and "Cert Hash(sha1): 58 0a 6f 4c c4 e4 b6 69 b9 eb dc 1b 2b 3e 08 7b 80 d0 67 8d.</p>
          <p>The policy for acceptable signature algorithms (and padding schemes) shall be possible to update. The exact method for updating the policy is determined by each authority (for example: Microsoft determines policies for binaries it is responsible for; SOC vendor for firmware updates). It is recognized that the initial ROM code need not have an ability to update the initial signature scheme.</p>
          <p>The platform shall maintain and enforce a policy with regards to signature authorities for firmware and pre-Operating System components; the policy (and hence the set of authorities) shall be possible to update. The update must happen either as a result of actions by a physically present authorized user or by providing a policy update signed by an existing authority authorized for this task. On ARM platforms, the physical presence alone is not sufficient. Signature authority (db or KEK) updates must be authenticated on ARM platforms.</p>
          <p>Upon power-on, the platform shall start executing read-only boot firmware stored on-die and use public key cryptography as per algorithm policy to verify the signatures of all images in the boot sequence up-to the Windows Boot Manager.</p>
          <p>Protection of physical memory from unauthorized internal DMA (for example: GPU accessing memory outside of video-specific memory) and all external DMA access to the SOC. The firmware shall enable this protection as early as feasible, preferably within the initial boot firmware.</p>
          <p>Optional.The memory containing the initial boot firmware (executing in SRAM) may be made inaccessible upon jumping to the next validated stage of the boot sequence. The initial boot firmware may remain inaccessible until power-on-reset is triggered.</p>
          <p>The platform shall enforce policy regarding the  replacement of firmware components. The policy must include protection against rollback. It is left to the platform vendor to define the exact method for policy enforcement, but the signature verification of all firmware updates must pass and the update must be identified in such a manner that a later version of a component cannot, without proper authorization (for example: physical presence), be replaced by an earlier version of the component where earlier and later may be defined by a (signed) version number, for example.</p>
          <p>Optional. The platform shall offer at least 112 logical eFuse bits to support platform firmware revision control in accordance with the above requirement.</p>
          <p>Physical Security Requirements. In retail parts, once the platform is configured for Production mode, the hardware must disable all external hardware debug interfaces such as JTAG that may be used to modify the platform's security state, and disable all hardware test modes and disable all scan chains. The disabling must be permanent unless re-enablement unconditionally causes  all device-managed keys that impact secure boot, TPM, and storage security to be rendered permanently erased.</p>
          <p>On ARM platforms Secure Boot Custom Mode is not allowed. A physically present user cannot override Secure Boot authenticated variables (for example: PK, KEK, db, dbx).</p>
          <p>Platforms shall be UEFI Class Three (see UEFI Industry Group, Evaluating UEFI using Commercially Available Platforms and Solutions, version 0.3, for a definition) with no Compatibility Support Module installed or installable. BIOS emulation and legacy PC/AT boot must be disabled.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>Multiple GPU features must meet all Graphics and System requirements and pass all tests in all available GPU operating modes. Windows certification tests are designed to ensure supported core Windows experiences work correctly, the system is reliable and that developers can count on graphics APIs conforming to the specification. In a single GPU system, these features are validated by the graphics device tests and system tests. Multiple GPU systems introduce special cases or modes that require special testing considerations. Multiple GPU's increases the complexity of the overall system and may expose the Windows system to unsupported features without careful analysis and testing. For the purpose of certification, there are three types of GPU features:</p>
          <p>Supported Features - these features were considered in the Windows design scenarios, are explicitly allowed, are tested by the Hardware Certification Kit, and can receive certification upon submission of the results.</p>
          <p>Features that require an addendum to certify - these features do not have explicit support by Microsoft in the OS runtimes, API's or kernel, but may be certified by IHVs and used in certified systems if the conditions placed on their use are met by the IHVs and OEMs. The Windows OS is usually unaware of these features. However, Microsoft recognizes these features may be designed and supported by the IHV in a manner not contrary to the Windows scenarios, and if the partners commit to supporting these features over the lifetime of the system, Microsoft will not block their use. The Microsoft graphics technical representative can provide additional information when it is unclear if a feature outside the Windows supported designs would be certifiable with an addendum or not allowed.</p>
          <p>Not allowed Features - these are features which create unavoidable scenarios running counter to Windows experience expectations, do not meet certification requirements and would prevent the system from getting certification.</p>
          <p>Microsoft makes no guarantee that features other than Supported Features (type 1 above) work correctly, or will continue to work correctly after patches, service packs or OS upgrades. Such features may appear to work correctly under test conditions but may fail catastrophically at some point in the future. These changes can result in unpredictable behavior or application failures, particularly as the OS and applications evolve and expose discrepancies. To assure no Windows features fail and to assure end-users that their experience will be reliable for the life of a product, the hardware manufacturers and the system manufacturers who are shipping a Windows feature that requires an addendum (type 2 above) must carry the responsibility for testing, supporting and servicing any divergence from supported features.  To be certified, the device's additional quality assurance and future support will be documented using the addendum process.Upon agreement of the terms of this Addendum the OEM:</p>
          <p>Declares the intent to ship a feature that is not supported by Microsoft Windows</p>
          <p>Declares no Windows features fail as a result of the feature.</p>
          <p>Upon evidence of a passing submission of the system, the addendum may be extended to the system.</p>
          <p> The conditions of the addendum are: </p>
          <p>Company will, or will require the responsible IHV partner to, thoroughly test Affected Company Product(s) with the objective to proactively detect and correct potential issues, and in any event before any delivery of an update to the Affected Company Products.    </p>
          <p>Monitor the reliability of the Windows unsupported feature using telemetry including but not limited to telemetry data provided by Microsoft.</p>
          <p>Upon discovery of a failure through telemetry or Microsoft notification, develop and timely distribute via Windows Update fixes for any end-user issues resulting in (1) Windows feature, application or kernel failures, (2) failures in third party Windows Store-style apps running on Windows, or (3) failures in Microsoft products including but not limited to Internet Explorer, Windows Live and Microsoft Office which are attributable to the Affected Company Product(s).  Timely means within no more than 3 months after a failure is discovered and for (1) above, at least 3 months before a patch, a service pack or a future Windows operating system becomes available, for (2) above, at least 3 months before a fix or a new or updated release of the affected app becomes available, and for (3) above, at least 3 months before a patch, a service pack or a future release of the affected Microsoft products becomes available.</p>
          <p>Company will enter into a separate agreement with the relevant Affected Company Product IHV to bind IHVs to the support obligations as described above.</p>
          <p>Microsoft, in collaboration with the IHV, may continue to update and distribute a driver for the device beyond the addendum commitment. </p>
          <p>The following guidelines detail some specific situations and typical problems this requirement is intended to address. This is not a comprehensive list of possible problematic situations. Other situations may be addressed in a successful addendum request for a specific Windows unsupported feature. </p>
          <p>Multiple GPUs are not allowed on ARM platforms. Windows has chosen to not allow or support multiple GPU systems for the Windows 8 release on ARM based systems.  Multiple GPU solutions would introduce additional complexity, and potential for untested features. For Windows 8 all ARM based systems must be configured with a single GPU only.</p>
          <p>In features where multiple GPUs are allowed, the system must meet the minimum performance requirements in every mode that can be configured. Performance requirements are described in this requirement (System.Fundamentals.Graphics.DisplayRender.Performance). A system certification submission will need to include the system level performance related results with a submission for both GPUs.</p>
          <p>Projection is a key Windows scenario, and the ability to clone the laptop lid to an external monitor with Win+P is a basic expectation of the end user. All mobile system must be able to "clone" or "extend" by using the Win+P key to the external port most likely used with a projector. </p>
          <p>A system must  correctly support the WDDM 1.2 "seamless boot" and bugcheck, PnP Start/Stop functionality:</p>
          <p>The "post" GPU must meet the seamless boot requirements as described in requirements   Device.Graphics.WDDM12.Display.DisplayOutputControl, System.Client.Firmware.UEFI.GOP.Display, and System.Fundamentals.Graphics.InternalDisplay.NativeResolution</p>
          <p>PnP stop of the WDDM driver  or a bugcheck must cause the frame buffer to be seamlessly handed off to the OS as described in requirement Device.Graphics.WDDM12.Display.PnpStopStartSupport</p>
          <p>Microsoft tests and validates the graphics API's to ensure conformance with the D3D specification/MSDN documentation. The graphics features and capabilities are always available once they have been enumerated. Applications are designed with these expectations, that the GPU device and capabilities are fixed for the runtime of the application. A system where these expectations are not true is not allowed.</p>
          <p>Windows supports surprise removals of the GPU only with hibernate. All other cases are not allowed. A system must not use a GPU that could be "surprise removed" in these other cases. An example of a feature that may result in unexpected surprise removal is a GPU in a docking station.</p>
          <p>Heterogeneous multiple GPU solutions can be allowed, however systems shipping with heterogeneous devices must have been certified with all GPUs present. For system certification purposes heterogeneous should be considered a Windows unsupported feature, requiring an addendum.</p>
          <p>Linked Display Adapter features have two operating modes: Linked, and Unlinked. Certification of devices that can be used in an LDA configuration must submit for certification with at least 1 device configured in the LDA feature and 1 device configured unlinked. This is to ensure that all expected Windows features pass in both modes.</p>
          <p>Features involving an i-GPU with a secondary d-GPU require an addendum to be certified.</p>
          <p>Lastly "Switchable Graphics solutions" where the display output is moved from one GPU to another GPU are not allowed. </p>

          <p> Design Notes:The following are definitions of multiple GPU variations used in this requirement.Homogeneous: A homogeneous multiple GPU feature consists of two or more GPUs from the same GPU vendor, using the same graphics driver. All GPUs are always on. Each GPU is visible to the application and there is no coordination between adapters and display output is not shared or switched between adapters. Linked Adapter: A linked adapter (LDA) feature has two or more identical GPUs from the same vendor, which share the graphics workload. In an LDA feature an application will access one GPU, but the work is distributed by the driver across multiple GPUs. Typically the application is not even aware of the existence of the multiple GPU's. Examples are AMD CrossfireX and NVIDIA SLI.Heterogeneous: A heterogeneous feature consists of two or more GPUs where there is no coordination between the adapters, and display output is not shared or switched between the adapters. The GPUs usually are from different GPU vendors although they may be from the same vendor. All GPUs are always on. In a heterogeneous feature each GPU is visible to the application. i- GPU with a Secondary d-GPU: Integrated GPU (i-GPU) with a Secondary Discrete GPU (d-GPU) has the integrated GPU sharing computation and rendering with an additional discrete adapter.  In this case the two GPUs may have different drivers and even be from different vendors.  In this feature, displays are not switched between the adapters; the main display is always physically connected via the i-GPU.  Examples are NVIDIA Optimus, AMD Hybrid PowerXpress and AMD Enduro.Switch-able Graphics: A Switch-able Graphics feature is two or more GPUs from either the same vendor or different vendors where the responsibility for display output to any monitor changes from one processor to the other, typically via a MUX. This feature is not allowed in Windows 8 systems and above.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>A system with multiple GPU's must meet logo requirements and pass testing in all available GPU modes. Multi-GPU system may have one or more integrated and/or discrete display adapters. A Hybrid/Switchable system must transition between GPU modes only on user consent. GPU mode transitions are triggered manually by the end-user unless it is completely transparent to the user with no visible effects. On initiation of the GPU switch, the Multiple GPU system must display an indication to the end-user to show which GPU mode they are currently in and running applications must not be stopped without user notification or consent. It is also possible to create a Pre-consent list by which the customer can chose to that the "dialog box" that came up during a mode switch be automatically for the particular scenario.If a system running in any multi-GPU mode is connected to an external display, the system must be able to transition into a Clone mode or Extended Desktop mode through CCD. Recommended time for CCD mode change should not be longer than an equivalent desktop mode change- preferably less than 5 seconds. If the system is connected to an external display device through an output connector who's GPU was powered off, recommended time for GPU switching should not be longer than a preferred time of 10 seconds so the user doesn't think the system is hung or not functioning properly. A multi-GPU system may have one or more integrated and/or one or more discrete display adapters. A multi-GPU system may have display adapters which do not support standard VGA. However, at least the boot device must be able to support standard VGA and the ability to reset to standard VGA resolutions from higher resolutions when needed. The hardware and system firmware must support VESA modes to allow at least the minimum desktop resolution for Windows by using the system VGA driver. To reset a device sufficiently implies that the device is fully functional as a VGA device. It must be fully functional when programmed via the video system firmware and when programmed directly through standard VGA registers.Mobile Platforms only:Mobile Multi-GPU systems must support Connecting and Configuring Displays (CCD). A Multi-GPU system may have one or more integrated and/or one or more discrete display adapters. Any display adapter which exposes an output connector to which a display device could be connected must be able to support all CCD functionality as specified in the WDDM 1.1 specification. On systems with multiple GPUs, the laptop lid target must not be reported as "connected" on more than one graphics adapter at any given time.Design Notes:The following are some examples of GPU operating modes.Linked Adapter: A linked adapter (LDA) configuration has two or more GPUs from the same vendor that are sharing the graphics workload. In a LDA configuration an application will access one GPU, but the work is distributed by the driver across multiple GPUs. Typically the application is not even aware of the existence of the multiple GPU’s. Examples are NVidia SLI and AMD Crossfire.Heterogeneous: A heterogeneous configuration consists of two or more GPUs from different GPU vendors. In a heterogeneous configuration each GPU is visible to the application. Switch-able Graphics: A Switch-able Graphics configuration is two or more GPUs from either the same vendor or different vendors where the primary purpose is to provide multiple power/performance modes for the GPU. Examples are AMD PowerExpress, and NVIDIA Hybrid power.The following is an example of a Hybrid switch.When the customer unplugs the system and the GPU will switch from dGPU to iGPU, the customer has a choice to select "do not ask again for this type of GPU transition" (wording to be reviewed by Usability team later). And all future unplug will initiate a GPU switch without a dialog box.</p>

              <td>
                <p>The purpose of this requirement is to ensure core Windows usage scenarios work correctly in each GPU mode of the system. This requirement was put in place because there have been instances where the GPUs have passed certification, but once integrated into the system, the overall system would fail fundamental scenarios. One example of such a failure was a multi-GPU laptop that could not project in one of its GPU operating modes. The system had to be reconfigured manually into another operating mode by the end user. However the end user had no way of understanding or determining why the laptop was failing to project. This problem was made even worse by the fact that the system was shipped by the OEM in a mode that could not project, and the OEM software regularly placed the laptop in to the mode where the laptop could not project, even after the user had discovered the root cause.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>Good graphics performance is crucial for all Windows 8 systems because users expect a smooth and responsive experience with their mainstream applications.</p>
          <p>All Windows 8 systems must have sufficient graphics performance to meet performance requirements and metrics for a collection of scenarios that represent mainstream applications.</p>
          <p>The tests encompass both high-level scenarios with Internet Explorer, including CSS animations, Windows Shell, and DirectX mini-scenarios.</p>
          <p>The high-level scenarios represent end-user perceived performance for commonly used applications. </p>
          <p>The DirectX scenarios are mini-apps with graphically rich content representing real world workloads. These mini-apps measure graphics performance using a number of common primitives that provide a proxy for real world productivity application performance. </p>
          <p>Metrics </p>
          <p>The following are the metrics that are measured for the applicable scenarios and used to determine the performance of a system.</p>
          <p>Time to First Frame for each application </p>
          <p>Time measured from process launch to first present hitting the screen. This measurement is done as a warm start. </p>
          <p>FPS </p>
          <p>Frames per second achieved while painting the contents of the window in a rendering loop</p>
          <p>Memory Score </p>
          <p>Memory score measures the total memory cost of graphics for a scenario. To calculate memory score, the driver is evaluated for memory being consumed in several scenarios. The benchmark aggregates results from different memory metrics (detailed later in this document) to arrive to a final score for the scenario. </p>
          <p>The memory benchmark is comprised of the following six scenarios:</p>
          <p>Idle</p>
          <p>Present</p>
          <p>Textures</p>
          <p>Buffers</p>
          <p>Surfaces</p>
          <p>Upload</p>
          <p>Glitching </p>
          <p>For scenarios with animations, users expect smooth animations at 60 Hz. This metric looks for the total number of frames missed and number of concurrent frames missed. This is done by measuring the present events for every vsync periods between start and end of animations ignoring the first and last incomplete vsync period. The metric measurement also verifies that DWM glitches are zero.</p>
          <p>Design Notes </p>
          <p>These tests run on battery power only if the system is a laptop or tablet/convertible. If the system is a desktop, the tests are run on A/C only.</p>
          <p>The following scenarios are instrumented and have goals for the metrics described:</p>

          <p>Bandwidth test </p>
          <p>The GPU bandwidth is evaluated by measuring the time it takes the GPU to compose the client area of a single application with simple content (for example: no overlap, no glass) at the native resolution of the panel. The test doesn't try to achieve peak bandwidth measurement under ideal circumstances, but is meant to measure a real world scenario that includes other necessary overhead such as setting up the hardware, context switching the GPU from the application context to the DWM context and reporting completion of the rendering operation through interrupt/fence mechanism. </p>
          <p>The goal for passing the Bandwidth test is dependent on the native resolution of the panel. The bandwidth is required to be sufficient to performat least 7.5 memory I/O operations per pixel at 60 FPS (or 450 * resolution.width * resolution.height * resolution.bpp). For example, this translates to the required bandwidth for the two common resolutions listed below:</p>

          <p>The test multiplies the number of pixels by7.5to provide for7.5 32-bit memory operations per pixel. If the measured bandwidth is greater than the required bandwidth, the test passes. </p>
          <p>GPU bandwidth is measured with the following scenarios:</p>
          <p>The DWM composes a single texture. This causes the GPU to perform the following memory operations per pixel:</p>
          <p>1 32-bit read</p>
          <p>1 32-bit write</p>
          <p>The DWM composes N textures with a pixel shader which samples from N textures. This causes the GPU to perform the following memory operations per pixel:</p>
          <p>N 32-bit reads</p>
          <p>1 32-bit write</p>
          <p>The number of textures tested (N) is the set {2, 3}.</p>
          <p>The DWM composes 3 primitives in 3 separate rendering operations:</p>
          <p>An opaque constant color is written. This causes the GPU to perform the following memory operations per pixel:</p>
          <p>1 32-bit write</p>
          <p>A transparent texture is composed on top (with alpha blending enabled). This causes the GPU to perform the following memory operations per pixel:</p>
          <p>2 32-bit reads</p>
          <p>1 32-bit write</p>
          <p>A second transparent texture is composed on top (with alpha blending enabled). This causes the GPU to perform the following memory operations per pixel:</p>
          <p>2 32-bit reads</p>
          <p>1 32-bit write</p>
          <p>In aggregate, this scenario performs 4 reads and 3 writes per pixel.</p>
          <p>The DWM composes an opaque solid color primitive followed by a transparent textured primitive. A 16-bit depth buffer is used, which causes the transparent primitive to be completely occluded. This causes the GPU to perform the following memory operations per pixel:</p>
          <p>2 16-bit reads</p>
          <p>1 16-bit write</p>
          <p>1 32-bit write</p>
          <p>An application renders a single BC (block compressed) texture onto a full-screen surface. This causes the GPU to perform the following memory operations per pixel:</p>
          <p>1 4-bit (BC1) or 8-bit read (BC2/BC3)</p>
          <p>1 32-bit write</p>
          <p>To account for time spent decompressing BC textures, the goal for this scenario is adjusted to be the same as the goal for the scenario that reads from a 32-bit texture (scenario 1).</p>
          <p>An application composes 2 textures with a pixel shader which samples from both textures. 1 texture uses the DXGI_FORMAT_R8_UNORM pixel format, while the other texture uses the DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8_UNORM pixel format. This causes the GPU to perform the following memory operations per pixel:</p>
          <p>1 8-bit read</p>
          <p>1 16-bit read</p>
          <p>1 32-bit write</p>
          <p>To account for time spent doing computation in the pixel shader, the goal for this scenario is adjusted to be the same as the goal for the scenario that reads from a single 32-bit texture (scenario 1).</p>
          <p>Memory Benchmark Test </p>
          <p>The memory benchmark is comprised of the following six scenarios:</p>
          <p>Idle</p>
          <p>Present</p>
          <p>Textures</p>
          <p>Buffers</p>
          <p>Surfaces</p>
          <p>Upload</p>
          <p>For each of the rendering scenarios, the goals are established by calculating:</p>
          <p>2MB allowed for OS overhead</p>
          <p>+2MB allowed for driver overhead per GPU in a link for x86 and x64 platforms; +1MB per GPU in a link allowed for ARM platforms. The number of linked GPUs on a system is determined and multiplied by the system-determined size per GPU to determine the total driver overhead allowed.</p>
          <p>+Size of surfaces explicitly created by application + 7.5% for alignment and padding in the case of non-power of two surfaces.</p>
          <p>+4KB overhead per surface created on 32-bit platforms; +8KB overhead per surface on 64-bit platforms.</p>
          <p>Except for the Present scenario, the rendering scenario targets are rounded to the next half-megabyte boundary.</p>
          <p>Idle </p>
          <p>The Idle scenario represents the memory cost of the driver shortly after boot on a minimal desktop with no application running other than the standard OS processes and the benchmark itself.</p>
          <p>The score is comprised of two elements:</p>
          <p>Memory footprint of the driver itself in memory (non-paged code and data page)</p>
          <p>Outstanding resource allocation by driver (pool, contiguous memory, mdl, locked memory) excluding video memory and limited to the kernel mode driver.</p>
          <p>The goal for the memory footprint is to be less than 10 MB and the goal for the outstanding resource allocation is to be less than 10 MB. The final benchmark idle score is less than the following:</p>

The impact can be felt by the user in the following way: High memory footprint impacts overall scalability of desktop based DX usage Long Device creation time affects the application launch time Driver has much higher CPU overhead in typical usage leading to poor experience on a typical workload.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>New systems shipping in Windows 8 that expect to be hybrid capable must adhere to the following requirements: </p>
          <p>A Microsoft supported hybrid system can only be composed as one integrated GPU(iGPU) and one discrete GPU(dGPU)</p>
          <p>Cannot have more than two GPUs</p>
          <p>Both GPU’s must be DX11.0 or higher</p>
          <p>Both GPU’s driver must be WDDM1.3 or higher</p>
          <p>Both GPUs must implement the new standard allocation type added to the KM and associated UM DDIs to support cross adapter shared surfaces. </p>
          <p>If each GPU has separate standard drivers, then they must be independent of each other and can be updated independently without breaking hybrid functionality</p>
          <p>The dGPU must be equal or higher performance than the iGPU</p>
          <p>The iGPU is the adapter that has outputs</p>
          <p>The dGPU adapter is one that </p>
          <p>sets the new discrete hybrid cap added to the WDDM 1.3 driver</p>
          <p>has no outputs</p>
          <p>All other multi-GPU configurations do not get Microsoft hybrid support. They will be treated the same way as defined by the “System.Fundamentals.Graphics.MultipleOperatingMode” requirement. </p>
          <p>D-list requirements</p>
          <p>This is the list of applications maintained by the dGPU IHV for choosing a GPU for an app to run in hybrid mode or not.</p>
          <p>The D-list DLL can be loaded into a process and queried at most once during D3D initialization</p>
          <p>The DLL size must be under 200KB</p>
          <p>The DLL must be able to return the GPU selection choice within 4ms</p>
          <p>Power Management Requirements</p>
          <p>Following are the power management requirements for the discrete GPU participating in a hybrid configuration:</p>
          <p>The driver is required to register for runtime power management</p>
          <p>The driver needs to register certain power components based on the following scenarios</p>

Examples:1. The integrated GPU and the Discrete GPU may have different VEN ID and DEV ID, but must have the same SSID. for example:---------------Display Devices---------------Card name: InField GFXManufacturer: OutStandingChip type: RUOK FamilyDAC type: Integrated RAMDACDevice Key: Enum\PCI\VEN_AAAA&amp;DEV_EEEE&amp;SUBSYS_9025104D&amp;REV_A1---------------Display Devices---------------Card name: Rocking Fast GFXManufacturer: Awesome ChipsChip type: 10Q FamilyDAC type: InternalDevice Key: Enum\PCI\VEN_BBBB&amp;DEV_DDDD&amp;SUBSYS_9025104D&amp;REV_072. The GPUs that is used in a Switchable machine must use a different SSID if also used in a non-switchable machine. For example:---------------Display Devices---------------Card name: InField GFXManufacturer: OutStandingChip type: RUOK FamilyDAC type: Integrated RAMDACDevice Key: Enum\PCI\VEN_AAAA&amp;DEV_EEEE&amp;SUBSYS_9999104D&amp;REV_A1Note that the OutStanding InField GFX in #1.

The values in each column areVendorID = The PCI vendor ID for the PC manufacturer. CompanyName = Name of the company go here. This should be consistent for each marker file. Division = this represents the division within the company. If your company doesn't not have divisions please put 'na.'Marketing Model Name = product name the system will be shipped as. This should be the same as the marketing name entered at the time of logo submission. Other info = optional ad can be added by putting more underscores. The additional fields may be used for identifying any other critical information about the system. Optionally, the _I field can be used as a part number that can be used to link the marketing model name to.  Design Notes:The marker file goes in the c:\windows\system32\drivers folder.</p>

          <p>The total system Standby (S3) resume time from CPU execution to resume complete, as measured by Windows® system tracing, must be two seconds or less. Total system resume time equals the sum of the system firmware S3 re-initialization time and Windows device initialization time, but does not include user mode initialization. "Resume complete" is defined as the point at which all system devices have completed their S0 power I/O Request Packet (IRP), but does not include the time required for devices to complete their D0 IRP or to become fully functional. A power test tool that includes arming and processing system trace events for resume time will be included in the WDK and will be used to test system resume time. Exceptions:</p>
          <p>Systems equipped with FBDIMM memory must complete S3 resume in 7 seconds or less.</p>
          <p>Systems with dual symmetrical CPU sockets must complete S3 resume in 3 seconds or less.</p>
          <p>Systems equipped with internal USB hub (excluding USB root hub) devices must complete S3 resume in at most 2 seconds plus the time required for the USB hub devices to initialize*. </p>
          <p>Design Notes:See "Windows On/Off Transitions Solutions Guide" at the following website:http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=61994The test for this requirement will automatically detect USB hub devices. USB hub devices are defined as USB-enumerated devices with Plug and Play (PnP) compatible hardware IDs that contain the string "USB\Class_09". The initialization time for each USB hub device will be calculated as the time required for the Microsoft USB hub functional device object (FDO) driver to receive and complete the S0 IRP for the USB hub device. The test will subtract this initialization time for each USB hub device from the total system resume time. The result must be less than 2 seconds.</p>

Every system must support wake from all implemented sleep states. Wake from S5 is only required from the power button.A mobile system installed with a client operating system must support either S3 (Sleep) or Connected Standby.  Systems that support Connected Standby must also support S4 (Hibernate).If a USB host controller is implemented on the system, then at least one external port on the controller must support wake-up capabilities from S3. If the system contains multiple USB host controllers, all host controllers integrated on the system board (that is, not add-on cards) must support wake-up from S3. USB host controllers are not required to support wake-up when a mobile system is running on battery power.Server systems are not required to implement S3, S4, or S5 states. If a server system does implement S3, S4 or S5 states, they must work correctly.Power Management is an important aspect of good user experience. The system should be able to control what devices to put into a sleep state when not being used. All devices must comply with the request from the system to go into a sleep state and not veto the request thereby putting an additional drain on the power source.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>All Connected Standby systems have requirements regarding thermal regardless of processor architecture and form factor. These requirements are tested for in the HCK. </p>
          <p>All CS systems must have at least one thermal zone.</p>
          <p>At least one thermal zone has critical shutdown temperature defined.</p>
          <p>Each thermal zone must report actual temperature on the sensor.</p>
          <p>All CS systems with fans must expose its activity to the OS.</p>
          <p>All CS systems with fans must keep the fan off while in “Sleep” or Connected Standby state.</p>
          <p>Active Cooling</p>
          <p>From the point of view of the OS, a platform has two strategies that it can use to implement fan control:</p>
          <p>Implement one or more ACPI thermal zones with active trip points to engage/disengage the fan.</p>
          <p>The Windows Thermal Framework supports active cooling devices at a very basic level. The only device supported inbox is an ACPI fan, and it can only be controlled with on/off signal. </p>
          <p>Implement a proprietary solution to control the fan (via drivers, an embedded controller, etc.).</p>
          <p>While Windows does not control the behavior of proprietary solutions for fans, Windows does support fan notifications to thermal manager for all implementations including embedded controllers so that diagnostic information and telemetry can be collected. Thus fan exposure to the OS is required for all Connected Standby systems and strongly recommended for all others.</p>
          <p>Note that the implementation for active cooling is completely separate from the passive cooling mitigations discussed above.</p>
          <p>ACPI Thermal Zone Controlled Fans</p>
          <p>Windows supports the ACPI 1.0 D-state based fan definition. Please refer to the ACPI spec for details. Thus the control is limited to fan on/off. The driver for the fan is provided in acpi.sys.</p>
          <p>The temperature sensor reads the temperature has crossed a trip point and issues Notify(0x80) on the associated thermal zone.</p>
          <p>The thermal zone reads the temperature with the _TMP control method and compares the temperature to the active trip points (_ACx) to decide whether the fan needs to be on or off.</p>
          <p>The OS puts the fan device in D0 or D3 which causes the fan to turn on or off.</p>
          <p>Multiple Speed Fan in ACPI</p>
          <p>In order to achieve multiple speeds for a fan using ACPI 1.0, there are two options:</p>
          <p>The thermal zone can contain multiple “fans”, when only one physical fan exists. Having more “fans” on at one time translates to faster fan speed. Please see Section 11.7.2 in the ACPI 5.0 specification for an example of this option.</p>
          <p>When the fan is on, it can decide for itself how fast to spin. Systems with embedded controllers, for example, can choose this option.</p>
          <p>Proprietary Solution for Fans</p>
          <p>Windows needs to be able to detect fan activity with either implementation. When a platform uses the ACPI thermal model, Windows is responsible for turning the fan on and off and therefore already knows when it is active. When a proprietary solution is used to control the fan, Windows needs notification that the fan is running. To enable this, Windows will support a partial subset of the ACPI 4.0 fan extensions, outlined in Table 6.</p>

          <p>Table 6: ACPI 4.0 fan object support in Windows </p>
          <p>Windows will use the _FST object to determine if the fan is running (Control field is nonzero) or off (Control field is zero). Windows will also support Notify(0x80) on the fan device as an indication that _FST has changed and needs to be reevaluated.</p>
          <p>A fan that implements the _FST object is not required to be in a thermal zone’s _ALx device list, but it is allowed to be. This allows for a hybrid solution, where a fan is typically controlled by a third party driver, but can be controlled by the OS thermal zone if the third party driver is not installed. If a fan is in an _ALx device list and is engaged by the thermal zone (placed in D0), the _FST object is required to indicate a non-zero Control value.</p>
          <p>For all fans, Windows will determine the state of the fan using the following algorithm:</p>
          <p>If a fan is in D0 (as a result of a thermal zone’s _ACx trip point being crossed), it is engaged.</p>
          <p>If a fan is in D3 and does not support the ACPI 4.0 extensions, it is disengaged.</p>
          <p>If a fan is in D3 and supports the ACPI 4.0 extensions, the OS will check _FST’s Control field for a non-zero value to see if the fan is engaged</p>
          <p>Fan Presence</p>
          <p>A platform indicates that there is a fan on the system by including a fan device (PnP ID PNP0C0B) in the ACPI namespace. Windows will take the presence of this device as an indication that the system has a fan, and the absence of this device as an indication that the system has no fan.</p>
          <p>Connected Standby Specific Guidance</p>
          <p>The Windows Thermal Management Framework is a part of the kernel and ships with all Windows systems. Thus, the material above applies to all machines. However, various types of machines require additional guidance more specific to Connected Standby.</p>
          <p>Connected Standby brings the smartphone power model to the PC.  It provides an instant on, instant off user experience that users have come to expect on their phone.  And just like on the phone, Connected Standby enables the system to stay fresh, up-to-date, and reachable whenever a suitable network is available.  Windows 8 supports Connected Standby on low-power platforms that meet specific Windows Certification requirements.</p>
          <p>Connected-Standby capable systems are highly mobile devices in a thin and light form factor.  Further, Connected Standby systems are always on and in the ACPI S0 state.  In order to deliver a robust and reliable customer experience, the entire system —from the mechanical design to firmware and software implementation— must be designed with critical attention to thermal characteristics.</p>
          <p>The system must include a temperature sensor for the SoC at a minimum.</p>
          <p>Processor Throttling</p>
          <p>The PPM communicates the maximum, desired and minimal performance levels to the PEP. Under thermal throttling conditions, the maximum performance level should equal the throttling performance requested by the thermal manager. The PEP then sets the CPU’s physical voltage and frequency based on the PPM’s performance level requirements.</p>

                <p>From a user perspective, the machine appears “off”. When the system is in connected standby, users expect it to be equivalent to the “sleep” action. Thus the fan is expected to never come on, just as in traditional machines during sleep. If the fan does come on, users may hear it and/or feel the hot air circulating and think that the computer has a bug. Therefore, the fan must not come on while running a realistic Connected Standby workload in a standard lab environment.</p>

          <p>(Table 2, offset 06h) Base Board Version </p>
          <p>1These fields must not have values equal to 0FFh. 2These fields gain prominence as fields which will be used for identifying unique system configurations for telemetry and servicing. The Manufacturer, Product Name, SKU Number and Family fields must not be longer than 64 characters in length. Avoid leading or trailing spaces or other invisible characters.3If the system has a field upgradeable embedded controller firmware; these values should not be equal to 0FFh.Design Notes: SKU Number has been moved to a required field in order to improve telemetry reporting. We encourage the OEM to be careful to fill in Manufacturer consistently and to fill in SKU Number with a value that can identify what the OEM considers a unique system configuration for telemetry and servicing. </p>

          <p>For Slate and Convertible PCs a slider or knob is not acceptable.  The volume control button must either be a rocker or two button combination with one button raising the volume level while the other lowers it.  Design Notes:Specifically for HD Audio implementations (see the referred specifications for the other two solutions); the HD Audio specification outlines how a codec can send an unsolicited response to software whenever a volume button is pressed or whenever a rotary quadrature encoder provides a pulse to the volume knob widget pins on the HD Audio codec. It is also possible to use an ADC and get the volume position data from an analog volume pot control, but the rotary quadrature encoder pulse method is recommended. The HD Audio specification specifies two methods of using the volume knob widget: direct and indirect. Microsoft recommends using the indirect method to ensure the best user experience with the Windows operating system.</p>

          <p>This requirement was formerly known as sysfund-0048.When measuring the audio signal on any line level audio output from the system, the audio noise level created by all of the components in the system must be minus 80dB FS regardless of PC system activity. This includes audio passed to replicate line level audio outputs in docking stations or port replicators. This requirement does not apply to audible acoustic noise from a system measured in air next to a PC system but rather to the analog noise generated on the audio signals generated by the system's streaming audio device by system components during various levels of system activity.Design Notes:  During various system loads such as high CPU usage, hard-disk activity, and CD or DVD playback, or mouse activity, network activity must not interfere with audio fidelity. The types of noise that typically create problems are mostly caused by ground loops; however, electromagnetic interference is also possible. The metric can be based either on the dynamic range or frequency response.</p>

          <p>This requirement was formerly known as SYSFUND-0067.Systems that include microphone array hardware must implement these according to the requirements as described in the "Microsoft Microphone Array Design" white paper. The array characteristics must be exposed to the Microsoft UAA class drivers through methods defined in the design guidelines and/or specification for each supported audio technology.If the microphone array is implemented through USB, see the Microsoft UAA USB Audio Design Guidelines and the microphone array white paper outlining how to expose the array geometry in the descriptors of the USB audio device.Depending on specific array geometry, report array characteristics by using the Windows audio device property set designed to expose the array geometry. See the Mic Array white paper for this info.Design Notes:The Microphone Array software support in Windows requires the array to meet certain design guidelines as outlined in the Microsoft Mic Array design guidelines. The guidelines have exact metrics for the array geometries but there is tolerance built into the windows mic array support. The mic array needs to report its geometry to windows accurately.Mic Array Whitepaper: http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/audio/micarrays.mspxAudio Device Technologies for Windows http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/audio/default.mspx  </p>

          <p>Enabling the Microsoft UAA HD Audio class driver to create a number of HD Audio logical audio devices is important to ensure a great standard experience when third-party drivers are not available. This is done by adhering to the Microsoft HD Audio pin configuration programming guidelines and exposing the following devices divided into areas based on audio device hardware functionality resources.Resource scenario #1: HD Audio device with hardware resources that support one independent render and one independent capture stream. The pin configurations must expose the following devices: </p>
          <p>1 independent output (speaker, headphone, redirected headphone or line out)</p>
          <p>1 independent input (microphone in, line in, mixed/muxed microphone in, or mixed/muxed line in)</p>
          <p>Resource scenario #2: HD Audio device with hardware resources that support two independent render and two independent capture streams. The pin configurations must expose the following devices: </p>
          <p>2 independent outputs (speaker, headphone, redirected headphone or line out)</p>
          <p>2 independent inputs or 1 independent input and 1 mixed/muxed input (microphone in or line in)</p>
          <p>Resource scenario #3: HD Audio device with hardware resources that support four or more independent render and two or more independent capture streams (SYSFUND-0047 compliant). The pin configurations must expose the following devices: </p>
          <p>1 multi-channel independent output (speaker, redirected headphone or line out)</p>
          <p>1 independent output (speaker, headphone or line out)</p>
          <p>2 independent inputs or 1 independent input and 1 or more mixed/muxed inputs (microphone in or line in)</p>
          <p>Resource scenario #4: HD Audio device with hardware resources that supports digital output (SPDIF or HDMI) output and/or digital (SPDIF or HDMI) input in addition to either of the first three resource scenarios (SYSFUND-0047 compliant). The pin configurations must expose the following devices in addition to the device required by the corresponding resource scenario: </p>
          <p>1 independent digital output such as SPDIF or HDMI</p>
          <p>1 independent digital input (if solution has this capability) such as SPDIF or HDMI</p>
          <p>For front panel audio jacks on a desktop or the side/front panel jacks on a mobile platform, at least one of the jacks must be defined as a Headphone output in the HD Audio codec's pin configuration register by the system firmware and function as such as the default behavior.Design Notes:  Independent resource is defined as a stream that can pass through the device without affecting any other exposed device in the system/codec.See the Pin Configuration Guidelines for High Definition Audio Devices white paper at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=58572.</p>

                <p>Without properly configured pin register defaults the Microsoft UAA HD Audio class driver will not be able to deliver a base level audio experience in the absence of a 3rd party driver. The justification for the class driver: System Integrators, OEMs/ODMs; Independent Hardware Vendors can depend on Microsoft provided drivers to cover Operating system upgrades &amp; installs, older or unsupported hardware, value products, SKUs where stability and security are imperative.  For end users, there is guaranteed audio support on upgrade or clean Windows installation.  It provides option for stable, secure audio when advanced features are not required.</p>

          <p>All PCI Express devices must comply with the PCI Base Express Specification 1.1 unless specified otherwise below.Reverse bridge implementations as defined in Appendix A of the PCI Express to PCI/PCI-X Bridge Specification are not supported in WindowsA reverse bridge will not be supported if it adheres to the guidelines and recommendations as defined in Appendix A of the PCI Express to PCI/PCI-X Bridge Specification, Revision 1.0. System firmware disables the extended (non-VC0) virtual channels in PCI Express devicesThe system firmware sets the VC enable bit (PCI Express Base Specification, Revision 1.0a, Section 7.11.7, "VC Resource Control Register: bit 31") to 0 for all extended (non-VC0) virtual channels in all PCI Express devices. This requirement does not apply to PCI Express High Definition Audio controllers, which use class code 04 and subclass code 03.Because extended support for VC hardware is optional, this requirement addresses the scenario in which incompatible VC hardware implementations might cause system reliability, stability, and performance issues.Hardware vendors are encouraged to work with Microsoft to define the future direction of extended virtual channel support.System firmware for PCI-X Mode 2 capable and PCI Express systems implements MCFG table for configuration space accessPCI-X Mode 2-capable and PCI Express systems must implement the MCFG ACPI table in PCI Firmware Specification, Revision 3.0.The configuration space of PCI-X Mode 2 and PCI Express devices must be accessible through the memory-mapped configuration space region defined in this table.PCI-to-PCI bridges comply with PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture SpecificationAll PCI-to-PCI bridges must comply with PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture Specification, Revision 1.2. Virtual bridges that comply with PCI Express also comply with PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture SpecificationPCI Express Base Specification, Revision 1.0a, virtual bridges must comply with PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture Specification, Revision 1.1.In addition, VGA 16-bit decode (Section 3.2.5.18, "Bridge Control Register, bit 4") and SSID and SSVID (Section 3.2.5.13) from PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture Specification, Revision 1.2, must also be supported. SSID and SSVID support is not required until January 1, 2011. If implemented, SSID and SSVID must meet the specification.SSVID is not required for PCIe to PCI/PCI-X bridges.Mobile system can assign distinct IRQs for at least six PCI devicesMobile systems must be able to assign at least six distinct interrupts for devices with a PCI configuration header. Note that if the system supports MSI, any devices that implement MSI can be counted against this minimum. x64-based system provides 64-bit support in PCI subsystemFor x64-based systems, all PCI bridges on the system board must support dual-access cycle (DAC) for inbound access, and DAC-capable devices must not be connected below non-DAC-capable bridges, such as on adapter cards.All new 64-bit adapters must be DAC capable.This DAC requirement does not apply to outbound accesses to PCI devices. However, for systems in which DAC is not supported on outbound accesses to PCI devices, the system firmware must not claim that the bus aperture can be placed above the 4-GB boundary.</p>

          <p>The system firmware for a system board that supports any type of enumerable riser card, such as AMR, ACR, and CNR, must include the following support: </p>
          <p>Detecting and enumerating each function on that type of riser device.</p>
          <p>Representing each function on that device so the relevant Windows bus enumerator (such as a PCI bus enumerator) can detect it and then locate and install appropriate drivers.</p>
          <p>For any riser card, the system firmware must provide a unique PCI SID assigned by the codec manufacturer. This requirement is identical to current requirements for audio and modem devices on a PCI add-on card. However, these riser cards are system-board devices, so the PCI SID must reflect that of the system-board manufacturer. If an OEM chooses a riser card and driver from any riser card driver manufacturer, the system firmware must populate the fields as follows: </p>
          <p>The PCI SVID must reflect the VID that the PCI-SIG assigned to that OEM.</p>
          <p>The SID must be unique for each AC '97 device configuration. For example, for a MoM, MR, or AMR device, each SID must be unique.</p>
          <p>If an OEM chooses a system board from a manufacturer that works with one or more codecs, the following applies:</p>
          <p>The SVID must reflect the VID that the PCI-SIG assigned to that system-board manufacturer.</p>
          <p>The SID must be unique for each AC '97 codec and device configuration. For example, for a MoM, MR, or AMR device, each SID must be unique.</p>
          <p>For an AMR device, the system firmware must properly implement the detection algorithm from Intel to verify that the hardware on an AMR or MR extension is actually present. </p>
          <p>Similar provisions exist in the CNR and ACR specifications.Design Notes:See the Intel documents for AC '97 at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=50733.  </p>

          <p>If implemented, system firmware may support switching a port between an EHCI or XHCI controller.  However only 1 controller may be active and identified to the OS for each USB port, and this controller may be switched only at boot time. Unless the XHCI controller is explicitly disabled in BIOS, the system firmware or a software filter driver must detect if the OS supports XHCI during boot, and if the OS supports XHCI, it must re-route the USB ports to the XHCI controller.Design Note:To test this requirement, the user will need to plug in both a USB 3.0 and a USB 2.0 device into each USB 3.0 port that supports routing to the EHCI controller. Confirm that Windows 8 detects these devices as connected to the XHCI controller. </p>

          <p>Transaction translators (TTs), integrated with the EHCI host controller, are not standardized, but the Windows EHCI driver supports several implementations of a controller- integrated TT. The supported integrated TT implementation must be identified in ACPI using the _HRV hardware revision for the USB controller. Please contact the USB team to determine if your implementation is supported and for more information about which _HRV value should be reported.If the USB EHCI controller does not feature an integrated TT, any externally exposed ports must be routed through an embedded rate-matching hub. For improved power efficiency and performance, USB Host Controllers on systems that support Connected Standby are recommended to be at least USB 3.0 compatible, with an XHCI controller integrated into the SoC or chipset. The operating system supports standard EHCI and XHCI controllers including debug registers. </p>

          <p>Once the system firmware applies power to the bus, for all xHCI ports, the SuperSpeed termination remains on unless the OS explicitly removes it.Design note:To test this requirement, the user will need to plug in a USB 3.0 peripheral device (that is, a non-hub). The device must meet the following requirement. Given these circumstances:</p>
          <p>Device is connected to a USB 3.0 connector </p>
          <p>Device is operating at USB 2.0 </p>
          <p>The connector's SuperSpeed termination transitions from Disabled to Enabled, but there is NOT a USB 2.0 reset</p>
          <p>The test may fail if the peripheral device connects over USB 3.0 under these circumstances, because such a device cannot be used to validate this requirement. The device must wait for a USB 2.0 reset before attempting to connect over USB 3.0.

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>Systems are recommended to expose at least one external USB host port. If a system exposes such port, the following requirement applies:</p>
          <p>For the best experience with Windows, systems that expose such port are recommended to have an externally accessible standard USB A port. This allows users to connect their existing USB devices, without an adapter. Standard USB A ports can also be used as a kernel debug port, to expose standard USB EHCI Host debug, USB XHCI host debug, or USB function debugging.</p>
          <p>While USB 2.0 capable controllers are acceptable, USB 3.0 XHCI host controllers are preferred. The USB ports must fully comply with the USB 3.0 or USB 2.0 specification. USB 3.0 connectors must properly support 900mA USB 3.0 devices, and 500 mA USB 2.0 and 1.1 devices. USB 2.0 ports must properly support 500 mA USB 2.0 and 1.1 devices.</p>
          <p>Windows supports several dual-role (OTG) USB controllers with an EHCI compliant host controller implementation. These dual-role controllers can be used primarily in host mode with the inbox Windows USB controller drivers. When properly configured, several of these supported dual-role controllers can be used as a kernel debug transport in function mode.</p>
          <p>If the system's form factor is too thin to expose a standard USB A port, it is acceptable to expose a micro-A/B port.  See the table below for the complete list of options. </p>
          <p>It is optional to include adapter that converts the port from micro USB to USB A.  If you bundle an adapter, the adapter speed must match that of the USB host controller.  For example, if the host controller is a USB 3.0 xHCI controller, then the adapter must support USB 3.0.  This adapter enables a user to connect a standard USB device to the micro-USB A/B port or proprietary docking port and port and must ground the USB ID pin of the port.</p>

          <p> Whatever USB port type is chosen, it must be correctly described in ACPI with the _UPC (USB Port Capabilities) package type parameter as defined in the ACPI 4.0a specification, section 9.13. This information allows Windows to determine when a micro-A/B port is exposed, and ID pin detection is necessary. </p>
          <p>A simple Standard USB A male to Micro USB B female adapter can be used to expose USB function or XHCI host debug transport from a Standard USB-A port. This adapter must prevent shorts on the VBus line by removing the VBus line completely or by having a 1kOhm resistor inline with the VBus line. It is strongly recommended that the standard USB A port provide built-in protection against a short on the VBus line. This can occur if the USB port is connected to another host when it is not properly configured in debug mode. </p>
          <p>If there is a standard USB A (host) port in addition to a micro-USB B (function debug) port, the USB ports must be connected to separate USB controllers. Thus, the micro-USB B (function) port can be connected to a USB OTG controller in function mode while the standard USB A (host) port would be connected to a USB host controller. </p>
          <p>If the micro-USB B port provides no additional functionality beyond debugging, it must be hidden in the battery compartment or behind a easily removable cover. In order to comply with USB-IF requirements, VBUS must not be asserted on the micro-A/B port until the resistance to ground of the ID pin of the micro-USB A/B port is less than 10 Ohms. This will prevent a short-circuit when a user connects a micro-USB B cable to another USB host, such as a desktop. Alternatively, the port can implement short protection circuitry for VBus.</p>

          <p>For systems that have xHCI controllers, any 2.0 and 3.0 (SuperSpeed) ports that are share a connection point must be routed to the same xHCI controller.  This requirement applies to all USB connection points, whether they are externally visible or not.This would explicitly prevent "companion controller" implementation of xHCI controllers in systems. Companion controller implementation for xHCI should be avoided because it can cause device issues such as bug checks, bad device states as well as devices going missing as well as provide a bad user experience. xHCI drivers should be able to handle all device speeds and types and thus a companion controller should not be necessary when integrating an xHCI controller into a system.Please see design notes for additional information.Design Notes:Referenced in the xHCI v1.x specification, section 4.24.2.2</p>

          <p>All USB devices and host controllers work properly upon resume from sleep, hibernation or restart without a forced reset of the USB host controllerDesign Notes:  Registry key ForceHCResetOnResume documented at the KB below is not needed for devices to function properly upon resume in Windows 7 or newer. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928631 Note that a known set of currently existing devices do require a forced reset upon resume, these devices should be covered in a list kept by the OS which will reset these devices upon resume. The goal of this requirement is to ensure that this list of devices which need a reset to appear after resume does not grow and that devices can properly handle sleep state transitions without being reset. A reset of the entire USB Host Controller results in significantly increased time that it takes for all USB devices to become available after system resume since there could be only one device at address 0 at a time, this enumeration has to be serialized for all USB devices on the bus. We have also seen that resetting the host controller can lead to an illegal SE1 signal state on some host controllers, which in turn can cause some USB devices to hang or drop off the bus. Moreover, devices cannot maintain any private state across sleep resume as that state will be lost on reset.</p>

                <p>Software is tolerant of this error if it is reported by the hardware in accordance with the spec.  If the error is not reported, further unexpected errors will occur later, because the host controller driver will continue to have an incorrect view of the state of the host controller.  No performant mitigations exist that cover all ways in which a controller could fail silently; therefore we will test for some failures in the HCK, and publish this requirement to highlight the importance of the error mechanism for save/restore state.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>Please reference ACPI specification version 4.0.The ACPI namespace hierarchy for USB devices should exactly match the devices hierarchy enumerated by Windows operating system.  All connectable USB ports are required to have a _PLD object. In addition, two fields in the _PLD object: Group token (Bit 86:79) and Group Position (Bit 94:87) should be correctly defined for all USB connection points, including those that are not visible externally (which should be indicated by setting bit 64 to zero). No two USB connection points should have identical combination of Group token and Group Position. If two ports are sharing a connection point, they should have identical _PLD objects. This information helps define the mapping of USB ports to uniquely identifiable connection points.  The Windows USB 3.0 stack will use this information to determine which ports are tied to the same connection points. Any USB port that does not have a _PLD object will be assumed to be not connectable and not visible (i.e. it is not being used at all).  The definition of connectable port as per ACPI 4.0 spec (section 9.13), is a port on which either a user can connect a device OR there is an integrated device connected to it. Please see design notes for additional information on how to implement this requirement.Design Notes:ExampleThis example is based on xHCI Spec (Version .95) Appendix D. The hardware configuration is exactly the same as in that Appendix. The ACPI representation of that hardware configuration differs in this example; those differences are highlighted.The following is an example of the ACPI objects defined for an xHCI that implements a High-speed and SuperSpeed Bus Instance that are associated with USB2 and USB3 Protocol Root Hub Ports, respectively. The xHCI also supports an integrated High-speed hub to provide Low- and Full-speed functionality. The External Ports defined by the xHC implementation provide either a USB2 data bus (i.e. a D+/D- signal pair) or a SuperSpeed (or future USB speed) data bus (i.e. SSRx+/SSRx- and SSTx+/SSTx-signal pairs). Where:  </p>
          <p>The motherboard presents 5 user visible connectors C1 - C5.</p>
          <p>Motherboard connectors C1 and C2 support USB2 (LS/FS/HS) devices.</p>
          <p>Motherboard connectors C3, C4 and C5 support USB3 (LS/FS/HS/SS) devices. </p>
          <p>The xHCI implements a High-speed Bus Instance associated with USB2 Protocol Root Hub ports, e.g. HCP1 and HCP2 are High-speed only, i.e. they provide no Low- or Full-speed support.</p>
          <p>The xHCI presents 7 External Ports (P1 - P7).</p>
          <p>External Port 1 (P1) is HS only and is not visible or connectable.</p>
          <p>External Ports 2 - 5 (P2 - P5) support LS/FS/HS devices.</p>
          <p>P2 is attached to motherboard USB2 connector C1.</p>
          <p>P3 is attached to motherboard USB2 connector C2.</p>
          <p>P4 is attached to the USB 2.0 logical hub of the Embedded USB3 Hub on the motherboard. The USB 2.0 logical hub supports the LS/FS/HS connections for 2 ports (EP1 - EP2)</p>
          <p>The USB 2.0 connections of motherboard hub ports EP1 and EP2 are attached to motherboard connectors C3 and C4 respectively, providing the LS/FS/HS support for the USB3 connectors. </p>
          <p>P5 is attached to motherboard connector C5, providing the LS/FS/HS support to the motherboard USB3 connector C5.</p>
          <p>External Port 6 (P6) is attached to the SuperSpeed logical hub of the Embedded USB3 Hub on the motherboard. The SuperSpeed logical hub supports the SS connections of 2 ports (EP1 - EP2).</p>
          <p>The SuperSpeed connections of motherboard hub ports EP1 and EP2 are attached to motherboard connectors C3 and C4 respectively, providing the SS support for the USB3 connectors.</p>
          <p>External Port 7 (P7) is attached to motherboard connectors C5, providing the SS support for the USB3 connector. </p>
          <p>The xHCI implements 4 internal HS Root Hub ports (HCP1 - HCP4), 2 High-speed and 2 SuperSpeed. </p>
          <p>Internal Port 1 (HCP1) maps directly to External Port 1 (P1).</p>
          <p>Internal Port 2 (HCP2) is attached to a HS Integrated Hub. The Integrated Hub supports 4 ports (IP1 - IP4).</p>
          <p>Ports 1 to 4 (IP1-IP4) of the Integrated Hub attach to External Ports 2 to 5 (P2-P5), respectively. </p>
          <p>Internal Ports 3 and 4 (HCP3, HCP4) attach to External Ports 6 and 7 (P6, P7), respectively. </p>
          <p>All connectors are located on the back panel and assigned to the same Group.</p>
          <p>Connectors C1 and C2 are USB2 compatible and their color is not specified. Connectors C3 to C5 are USB3 compatible and their color is specified.</p>
          <p>External Ports P1 - P5 present a USB2 data bus (i.e. a D+/D- signal pair). External Ports P6 and P7 present a SuperSpeed data bus (i.e. SSRx+/SSRx- and SSTx+/SSTx- signal pairs).</p>

Design note:To test this requirement, the user will need to plug in a USB 3.0 peripheral device (that is, a non-hub).  The device must meet the following requirement.  Given these circumstances:</p>
          <p>Device is connected to a USB 3.0 connector</p>
          <p>Device is operating at USB 2.0</p>
          <p>The connector's SuperSpeed termination transitions from Disabled to Enabled, but there is NOT a USB 2.0 reset</p>
          <p>The test may fail if the peripheral device connects over USB 3.0 under these circumstances, because such a device cannot be used to validate this requirement.  The device must wait for a USB 2.0 reset before attempting to connect over USB 3.0.  For more information about the expected behavior of peripheral devices, see section 10.16.1 of the Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification. </p>

          <p>A platform that does not support a separate, and from the main CPU(s) isolated, cryptographic processing unit must support a Trusted Execution Mode. The Trusted Execution Mode must have a higher privilege level than the Normal Execution Mode, giving it access to data and code not available to the Normal Execution Mode.</p>
          <p>During the boot sequence, the boot firmware/software shall measure all firmware and all software components it loads after the core root of trust for measurement is established. The measurements shall be logged as well as extended to platform configuration registers in a manner compliant with the following requirements.</p>
          <p>The measurements must be implemented such that it reliably and verifiably allows a third party to identify all components in the boot process up until the point either the boot finished successfully or when software with a exploited vulnerability was loaded (for example, if the third component loaded includes an exploited vulnerability, then values for the first, second, and third component in the trusted boot log correctly reflect the software that loaded but any values after that may be suspect). To achieve this, the trusted execution environment must provide a mechanism of signing the values of the registers used for Trusted Boot. The interface to the signature ("attestation") mechanism shall comply with the requirements defined in Microsoft Corporation, "Trusted Execution Environment ACPI Profile, 1.0 dated March 2, 2012".</p>
          <p>The system shall include a trusted execution environment supporting the command set defined in Microsoft Corporation, "TPM v2.0 Command and Signature Profile, 1.0 dated March 2, 2012."</p>
          <p>The system shall support the interface specified in Microsoft Corporation, "Trusted Execution Environment ACPI Profile, 1.0 dated March 2, 2012".</p>
          <p>The system shall support the interface and protocol specified in Microsoft Corporation, "Trusted Execution Environment EFI Protocol, 1.0 dated March 2, 21012," with the exception of the PCR[7] measurements specified in Appendix A of that document.</p>
          <p>The system is required to support measurements into PCR [7] as specified in Appendix A of Microsoft Corporation, "Trusted Execution Environment EFI Protocol,.1.0 dated March 2, 2012" specification. The UEFI firmware update process must also protect against rolling back to insecure firmware versions, or non-production versions that may disable secure boot or include non-production keys. A physically present user may however override the rollback protection manually. In such a scenario (where the rollback protection is overridden), the TPM must be cleared.</p>
          <p>Note: Bitlocker attempts to utilize PCR7 for better user experience and to limit PCR brittleness. If Secure Boot launch of Windows 8 BootMgr requires use of an Allowed DB entry other than the Microsoft-provided EFI_CERT_X509 signature with "CN=Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011" and "Cert Hash(sha1): 58 0a 6f 4c c4 e4 b6 69 b9 eb dc 1b 2b 3e 08 7b 80 d0 67 8d, then Bitlocker will not be able to utilize PCR7. It is therefore recommended that the only Allowed DB entry for Secure Boot are Microsoft-provided EFI_CERT_X509 signature with "CN=Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011" and "Cert Hash(sha1): 58 0a 6f 4c c4 e4 b6 69 b9 eb dc 1b 2b 3e 08 7b 80 d0 67 8d.</p>
          <p>Platform firmware must ensure invariance of PCRs 0, 2, and 4 across power cycles in the absence of changes to the platform's static core root of trust for measurements (SRTM). Platform firmware must ensure invariance of PCR[7] if implemented as specified in Microsoft Corporation, "Trusted Execution Environment EFI Protocol,.1.0 dated March 2, 2012" across power cycles in the absence of changes to the platform's static core SRTM. Attaching a (non-bootable) USB to the platform or attaching the platform to a docking station shall not cause changes to the SRTM.</p>
          <p>If the platform does not support clearing the TPM 2.0 endorsement hierarchy (for example, using TPM2_ChangeEPS), an Endorsement Kit (EK) certificate must be provisioned in the TPM NV RAM.</p>
          <p>Execution of the TPM 2.0 command TPM2_NV_Increment must not require an open object slot.</p>
          <p>TPM must meet performance requirements as stated below: Prior to exit boot services, TPM shall complete extend operations within 20msec. After exit boot services, TPM Extend operations shall complete within 20mS when a TPM is not in a lower power state. If a TPM is in a low power state Extend operations shall complete in 20mS after the TPM has exited its low power state.</p>
          <p>Design Notes</p>
          <p>Microsoft uses the term TPM 2.0 for what is also known as TCG TPM.Next.</p>
          <p>These requirements may also be met through sealed storage/sealed key blobs that, upon unseal, are held in isolated storage.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>A system that implements a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 1.2 must include a TPM that complies with the TCG TPM Main Specification, Version 1.2, Revision 103 (or a later revision), parts 1, 2 and 3.  (http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tpm_main_specification) The TPM must meet the following additional requirements:</p>
          <p>The time required for the TPM to perform all the self-testing performed by the  TPM_ContinueSelfTest command must be less than 1 second.</p>
          <p>If the TPM receives a command, after receipt of the TPM_ContinueSelfTest command, but prior to the completion of the TPM_ContinueSelfTest self-test actions, it must not return TPM_NEEDS_SELFTEST.</p>
          <p>The TPM's monotonic counter must be designed to increment at least twice per a platform boot cycle.</p>
          <p>The TPM must implement the TPM_CAP_DA_LOGIC capability for the TPM_GetCapability command.</p>
          <p>By default, the TPM dictionary attack logic must permit at least 9 authorization failures in an a 24 hour time period before entering the first level of defense.  Small durations of lockout for less than five seconds are acceptable within a 24 hour period with 9 authorization failures if the TPM leaves the lockout state automatically after five seconds elapses.  Alternately, the default system image must contain non-default software anti-hammering settings which correspond to TPM default behavior.  (In the Windows 8 OS the settings can be seen by running gpedit.msc then expanding the following in the left tree view:  Local Computer Policy\Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Trusted Platform Module Services. The values to customize are:  Standard User Lockout Duration, Standard User Individual Lockout Threshold, and Standard User Total Lockout Threshold.) </p>
          <p>The TPM dictionary attack logic must not permit more than 5000 authorization failures per a year.</p>
          <p>To help platform manufacturers achieve as fast of a boot as possible, the shorter the TPM_ContinueSelfTest execution time, the better.</p>
          <p>It is recommended platform manufacturers provide information about the TPM's dictionary attack logic behavior in customer documentation that includes explicit steps to recover after the TPM enters a locked out state.</p>
          <p>It is recommended the TPM state when shipped is enabled and activated.</p>
          <p>Note:  Windows uses more TPM functionality than previous releases so Windows Certification Tests for the TPM are more extensive.  </p>

          <p>If the platform implements UEFI firmware, it must implement</p>
          <p>The TCG EFI Platform Specification Version 1.20, Revision 1.0 or later, http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tcg_efi_platform_specification_version_120_revision_10.</p>

Note: The errata version 1.21 is strongly recommended instead. (http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/pc_client_work_group_specific_implementation_specification_for_conventional_bios_specification_version_12).</p>
          <p>The TCG ACPI General Specification Version 1.00, Revision 1.00, http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/server_work_group_acpi_general_specification_version_10. </p>
          <p>Windows Vista BitLocker Client Platform Requirements, dated May 16, 2006, or later (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=70763). For conventional BIOS systems instead of the PCR measurements listed in the Windows Vista BitLocker Client Platform Requirements, a system may implement the PCR measurements defined in the TCG PC Client Workgroup Specific Implementation Specification for Conventional BIOS, Version 1.21, Revision 1.00. </p>
          <p>And the system MUST meet the following additional requirements:</p>
          <p>Platform firmware must ensure invariance of PCRs 0, 2 and 4 and also PCR 7 if implemented as specified in Appendix A of the Microsoft Corporation, "Trusted Execution Environment EFI Protocol, 1.00 dated March 2nd, 2012" document across power cycles in the absence of changes to the platform's static root of trust for measurements (SRTM). Attaching a (non-bootable) USB to the platform or attaching the platform to a docking station shall not cause changes to the SRTM.</p>
          <p>If the platform is a server platform, it must reserve PCRs 8 through 15 for OS use. (Note: The same requirement is true for client platforms.)</p>
          <p>The platform must implement the memory mapped space for the TPM interface (for example, legacy port based I/O is not sufficient).</p>
          <p>The system firmware must perform Physical Presence Interface operations when the platform is restarted. It is strongly recommended the system firmware performs Physical Presence Interface operations also after shutdown. (Specifically, the Physical Presence Interface Specification Version 1.2, section 2.1.4: Get Platform-Specific Action to Transition to Pre-OS Environment must return a value of 2: Reboot.) (This requirement allows remote administrators to perform Physical Presence Operations without needing to be physically present to turn the platform back on.)</p>
          <p>The default configuration for the system must have the NoPPIProvision flag specified in the TCG Physical Presence Interface Specification, section 2: Physical Presence Interface set to TRUE.</p>
          <p>The default system firmware configuration must allow the OS to request Physical Presence operations 6, 7, 10, and 15. Note: The operations are described in Table 2 of the TCG Physical Presence Interface Specification Version 1.2, Revision 1.00.</p>
          <p>If the system implements the NoPPIClear flag it should do so as specified in the TCG Physical Presence Interface Specification, section 2: Physical Presence Interface. The platform should either provide a system firmware configuration setting to change the flag or implement physical presence operations 17 and 18. Note: The operations and the NoPPIClear flag are described in Table 2 of the TCG Physical Presence Interface Specification Version 1.2, Revision 1.00. (Implementing this flag helps facilitate automated testing of the physical presence interface during Windows certification testing and permits managed environments to completely automate TPM management from the OS without physical presence if an enterprise decides to set the NoPPIClear flag.)</p>
          <p>The system firmware must implement the _DSM Query method (function index 0) in addition to the Physical Presence Interface methods defined in the TCG Physical Presence Interface Specification, section 2: ACPI Functions. (Please refer to the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Specification Revision 5.0 for an implementation example of the _DSM Query method.)</p>
          <p>The system firmware must implement the _DSM Query method (function index 0) in addition to the Memory Clear Interface method defined in the TCG Platform Reset Attack Mitigation Specification, section 6: ACPI _DSM Function. (Please refer to the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Specification Revision 5.0 for an implementation example of the _DSM Query method.)</p>
          <p>The system firmware must implement the auto detection of clean OS shutdown and clear the memory overwrite bit as defined in the TCG Platform Reset Attack Mitigation Specification, section 2.3: Auto Detection of Clean Static RTM OS Shutdown. Exception: If the system is able to unconditionally clear memory during boot without increasing boot time, the system may not implement the auto detection (however the pre-boot and ACPI interface implementations are still required).</p>
          <p>When the system is delivered to an end customer, the TPM permanent flag TPM_PF_NV_LOCKED must be set to TRUE. (This requirement is for systems. For motherboards the flag may be set to FALSE when delivered to the platform manufacturer, however instructions/tools must advise platform manufacturers to set the flag to TRUE before delivery to end customers.)</p>
          <p>When the system is delivered to an end customer, the TPM permanent flag TPM_PF_NV_ PHYSICALPRESENCELIFETIMELOCK must be set to TRUE. (This requirement is for systems. For motherboards the flag may be set to FALSE when delivered to the platform manufacturer, however instructions/tools must advise platform manufacturers to set the flag to TRUE before delivery to end customers.)</p>
          <p>The system must contain a full Endorsement Key (EK) certificate stored in the TPM NV RAM as described in the TCG PC Client Specific Implementation Specification for Conventional BIOS, section 7.4.5: TCG_FULL_CERT. The NV RAM index used for storing the EK certificate must be the pre-defined and reserved index TPM_NV_INDEX_EKCert as defined the TPM Main Specification, Part 2, section 19.1.2: Reserved Index Values. As recommended in the TCG PC Client Specific Implementation Specification for Conventional BIOS, section 4.2.1: TPM Main Specification Reserved Indexes, the D bit attribute must be set for the index. (Note: The certificate may be created by the TPM manufacturer or the platform manufacturer.) Exception: If the system supports generation of a new EK it is not required (but is still strongly recommended) to have an EK certificate.</p>
          <p>The system firmware must ship with the TPM enumerated by default. (This means the ACPI device object for the TPM must be present by default in the system ACPI tables.)</p>
          <p>The system firmware must support clearing the TPM from within a setup menu.</p>
          <p>At least 256 bytes of TPM NVRAM must be reserved (and available) for OS use.</p>
          <p>The firmware must issue the TPM_ContinueSelfTest during boot such that the self-test completes before the OS loader is launched.</p>
          <p>If the TPM device performs the self-test synchronously, the firmware TPM driver should be optimized to issue the command to the device but allow the boot process to proceed without waiting for the return result from the TPM_ContinueSelfTest command. If the firmware TPM driver receives a subsequent command, it should delay the subsequent command until the TPM_ContinueSelfTest command completes instead of aborting the TPM_ContinueSelfTest command.)</p>
          <p>A recommendation is to start the self-test before some action which takes at least one second but does not have a dependency on the TPM.</p>
          <p>The platform may or may not issue the TPM_ContinueSelfTest upon resume from S3 (sleep).</p>
          <p>The ACPI namespace location for the TPM device object must only depend on the System Bus, ISA or PCI bus drivers provided by Microsoft. The System Bus does not have an ID, but is identified as \_SB. The ISA bus device IDs may be PNP0A00 or PCI\CC_0601. The PCI bus device IDs may be PNP0A03 or PCI\CC_0604. In addition, the TPM device object may also depend on these generic bridges, containers or modules: PNP0A05, PNP0A06 and ACPI0004. No other device dependencies are permitted for the ACPI namespace location for the TPM device object.</p>
          <p>Optional. The platform is recommended to support measurements into PCR [7] as specified in Appendix A of Microsoft Corporation, "Trusted_Execution_Environment_EFI_Protocol, 1.00 dated March 2, 2012" specification, The UEFI firmware update process must also protect against rolling back to insecure firmware versions, or non-production versions that may disable secure boot or include non-production keys. A physically present user may however override the rollback protection manually. In such a scenario (where the rollback protection is overridden), the TPM must be cleared. </p>
          <p>Note: Bitlocker utilizes PCR7 for better user experience and limit PCR brittleness. If Secure Boot launch of Windows BootMgr requires use of an Allowed DB entry other than the Microsoft-provided EFI_CERT_X509 signature with "CN=Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011" and "Cert Hash(sha1): 58 0a 6f 4c c4 e4 b6 69 b9 eb dc 1b 2b 3e 08 7b 80 d0 67 8d, Bitlocker will then not be able to utilize PCR7. It is recommended that the only Allowed DB entry for Secure Boot are Microsoft-provided EFI_CERT_X509 signature with "CN=Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011" and "Cert Hash(sha1): 58 0a 6f 4c c4 e4 b6 69 b9 eb dc 1b 2b 3e 08 7b 80 d0 67 8d.</p>

          <p>Selective suspend is an important power saving feature of USB devices. Selective suspension of USB devices is especially useful in portable computers, since it helps conserve battery power.If a USB device is internally connected, the device driver must enable selective suspend by default. Every USB device driver must place the device into selective suspend within 60 seconds of no user activity. This timeout should be as short as possible while maintaining a good user experience. The selective suspend support can be verified by reviewing the report generated by the powercfg -energy command.Implementation Notes:When devices enter selective suspend mode, they are limited to drawing a USB specification defined 2.5mA of current from the USB port. It is important to verify that devices can quickly resume from selective suspend when they are required to be active again. For example, when selectively suspended, a USB touchpad must detect be able to detect a user's touch and signal resume without requiring the user to press a button. Some devices can lose the ability to detect a wake event when limited to the selective suspend current, 500 microamps per unit load, 2.5mA max. These devices, such as a USB Bluetooth module, must be self-powered, not relying solely on the USB bus for power. By drawing power from another source, the device can detect wake eventsFor more information about enabling selective suspend for HID devices, please refer to this MSDN article http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff538662(VS.85).aspxFor more information about how to implement selective suspend in a driver, please refer to this white paper:http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/wdf/USB_select-susp.mspx To specify a port that is internal (not user visible) and can be connected to an integrated device, the ACPI properties _UPC.PortIsConnectable byte must be set to 0xFF and the _PLD.UserVisible bit must be set to 0. More details are available on MSDN.</p>

                <p>Many devices, such as fingerprint readers and other kinds of biometric scanners, only require power intermittently. Suspending such devices, when the device is not in use, reduces overall power consumption. More importantly, any device that is not selectively suspended may prevent the USB host controller from disabling its transfer schedule, which resides in system memory. DMA transfers by the host controller to the scheduler can prevent the system's processors from entering deeper sleep states. All connected USB devices must be selective suspended before the host controller can become idle. Thus, it is extremely important that USB devices expected to be connected for prolonged periods of time implement selective suspend correctly, especially embedded devices "inside the plastic."</p>

          <p>Baseboard management controller (BMC) hardware that uses the Microsoft provided IPMI driver and service provider must comply with the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) Specification, Version 1.5 Document (Revision 1.1, February 20, 2002, 6/1/04 MARKUP) or later.The BMC must be connected to the system through a Keyboard Controller Style (KCS) Interface. The BMC and its KCS interface must be discoverable through ACPI, as prescribed in Appendix C3 of the IPMI V1.5 specification.Support for interrupt is optional for the BMC. If interrupt is supported, the BMC: </p>
          <p>Must not be shared with other hardware devices.</p>
          <p>Must support the Set Global Flags command.</p>
          <p>The BMC driver must support PnP and Power Management according to the minimum device fundamental requirements defined in the Windows Logo Program requirements.The driver must be compliant to the kernel-mode driver framework (KMDF) component of the Windows Driver Framework (WDF) for the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems. A legacy driver, for backward compatibility reasons, must be Windows Driver Model (WDM) compliant.The driver must provide a WMI interface, including Timeout Configuration through RequestResponseEx() which is defined in the ipmidrv.mof file of the WMI interface.The driver must have support for ACPI Control: </p>
          <p>HARDWARE ID - IPI0001</p>
          <p>COMPATIBLE ID - IPI0001 optional</p>
          <p>_SRV - 1.5 or 2.0 IPMI</p>
          <p>_CRS/_PRS - Format of resources: A single 2-byte or two 1-byte each I/O port or memory mapped I/O</p>
          <p>The driver must call the Windows ACPI driver to get the above listed ACPI data.Support for interrupt is optional in the driver, if supported the IPMI driver must: </p>
          <p>Assign only one interrupt</p>
          <p>Not share interrupts</p>
          <p>Handle disabling of non-communication interrupts that the driver does not fully support through the Set Global Flags command.</p>
          <p>Be capable of handling both communication and non-communication interrupts.</p>
          <p>Design Notes:To prevent interrupt storm, the driver enables BMC interrupt when it starts and disables BMC interrupt supports when stops by using the "Set BMC Global Enables" IPMI command. The field needs to set is the bit [0] - Receive Message Queue interrupt. However, this bit is shared for KCS communication interrupt and KCS non-communication, so the driver needs to be able to properly handle both interrupts.A KCS communication interrupt is defined as an OBF-generated interrupt that occurs during the process of sending a request message to the BMC and receiving the corresponding response. It's also encountered during the course of processing a GET_STATUS/ABORT control code.A KCS non-communication interrupt is defined as an OBF-generated interrupt that occurs when the BMC is not in the process of transferring message data or getting error status. This will typically be an interrupt that occurs while the interface is in the IDLE_STATE]. </p>

          <p>Server System vendors which elect to set  the Advanced Error Reporting (AER) bit (0x3) in the PCI _OSC table in the system BIOS must implement the following:·         The _HID value on the root bus of the system must be PNP0A08, so that the operating system can discover the devices are PCI Express and support AER. ·         To use PCI AER with Windows the system must report _OSC control in the device and the _SB/PC10 objects in ACPI. The following bits must be enabled:      · 0x0 - PCI Express Native Hot Plug      · 0x1 - Hot Plug Control      · 0x3 - Advanced Error Reporting (AER)      · 0x4 - PCI Express reliability structure control ·         The MCFG ACPI table in PCI Firmware Specification, Revision 3.0b, so that the operating system can access the AER Capability registers in the PCIe extended configuration space.Design Notes: This is an If Implemented requirement for Server system vendors. There is no Windows Server 8 requirement to provide AER_OSC to give control to the operating system, and systems may implement a "firmware first" error policy.</p>

          <p>Systems must meet the requirements listed below and pass the Fault Tolerance test in the Windows Hardware Certification Kit in order to be listed in the Windows Server Catalog as having Fault Tolerance.A Fault Tolerant set [FT set] of systems is a grouping of systems that provide redundancy for every hardware component in a single system of the FT set and can mask any hardware failure such that network-connected clients are not impacted by the hardware failure, such as by loss of connectivity due to network timeout to the FT set due to the host name, domain name, MAC address or IP address, and the services or applications hosted on the FT set, becoming unavailable to those network connected clients. Additionally, an FT set appears to network-connected clients as one system with a single host name, domain name, MAC address or IP address, and unique instances of services or applications.An FT set must include system clocks that operate in actual lockstep, i.e., there is only one clock domain for the FT set, or virtual lockstep, i.e., the clocks in the systems that comprise the FT set are synchronized at regular intervals of much less than one second. This allows the FT set to always respond to exactly the same interrupts at exactly the same time, and thus be executing exactly the same instructions and have exactly the same state at all times, thus providing the required redundancy. An FT set is able to resynchronize, i.e., make identical, operating system images after a hardware failure in one system of the FT set is corrected, such that network-connected clients are not impacted by the resynchronization, such as by loss of connectivity due to network timeout to the FT set due to the host name, domain name, MAC address or IP address, and the services or applications hosted on the FT set, becoming unavailable to those network connected clients. The correction of the problem may be by replacement or repair of the failed hardware component, or if the hardware failure is transient, may be cleared by a system reset that forces the re-initialization of all the devices in the system that is part of the FT set.FT systems may disable or not include devices which could cause asynchronous interrupts to occur such that one system in the FT redundant set had to respond to an interrupt to which the other system(s) of the FT set did not experience. Examples of such devices would be monitoring devices [thermal, voltage, etc.], or external devices that would allow a user to inadvertently interrupt or access only one system in an FT set, such as a CD/DVD device, keyboard, mouse, etc.  </p>

          <p>If the system firmware supports UEFI, it may chose to additionally support the Graphics Output Protocol (GOP). If the Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) is supported is must be as defined in UEFI 2.3.1. During this time when the firmware is in control, the following are the requirements:Topology Selection</p>
          <p>UEFI must reliably detect all the displays that are connected to the POST adapter. The Pre-OS screen can only be displayed on a display connected to the POST adapter. </p>
          <p>In case multiple displays are detected, UEFI must display the Pre-OS screen based on the following logic</p>
          <p>System with an Integrated display(Laptop, All In One, Tablet): UEFI must display the Pre-OS screen only on the integrated display </p>
          <p>System without an Integrated display (integrated display is shut or desktop system): UEFI must display the Pre-OS screen on one display. UEFI must select the display by prioritizing the displays based on connector type. The prioritization is as follows: DisplayPort, HDMI, DVI, HD15, Component, S-Video. If there are multiple monitors connected using the same connector type, the firmware can select which one to use. </p>
          <p> Mode Selection</p>
          <p>Once UEFI has determined which display to enabled to display the Pre-OS screen, it must select the mode to apply based on the following logic</p>
          <p>System with an Integrated display(Laptop, All In One, Tablet): The display must always be set to its native resolution and native timing</p>
          <p>System without an Integrated display (desktop): </p>
          <p>UEFI must attempt to set the native resolution and timing of the display by obtaining it from the EDID.</p>
          <p>If that is not supported, UEFI must select an alternate mode that matches the same aspect ratio as the native resolution of the display. </p>
          <p>At the minimum, UEFI must set a mode of 1024 x 768</p>
          <p>If the display device does not provide an EDID, UEDI must set a mode of 1024 x 768</p>
          <p>The firmware must always use a 32 bit linear frame buffer to display the Pre-OS screen</p>
          <p>PixelsPerScanLine must be equal to the HorizontalResolution.</p>
          <p>PixelFormat must be PixelBlueGreenRedReserved8BitPerColor. Note that a physical frame buffer is required; PixelBltOnly is not supported.</p>
          <p>Mode Pruning</p>
          <p>UEFI must prune the list of available modes in accordance with the requirements called out in EFI_GRAPHICS_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL.QueryMode()  (as specified in the UEFI specification version 2.1)</p>
          <p>Providing the EDID</p>
          <p>Once the UEFI has set a mode on the appropriate display (based on Topology Selection), UEFI must obtain the EDID of the display and pass it to Windows when Windows uses the  EFI_EDID_DISCOVERED_PROTOCOL (as specified in the UEFI specification version 2.1 )to query for the EDID. </p>
          <p>It is possible that some integrated panels might not have an EDID in the display panel itself.  In this case, UEFI must manufacture the EDID. The EDID must accurately specify the native timing and the physical dimensions of the integrated panel</p>
          <p>If the display is not integrated and does not have an EDID, then the UEFI does not need to manufacture an EDID</p>

                <p>Modern boot experience requires a preboot environment which is both fast and visually appealing. The system UEFI controls the display before Windows takes over the control. This means that the screen controlled by the firmware is the first thing that the user sees. Therefore, it is very important that the user has a great user experience at this stage. Some of the key goals are:Ensure that the screen is visible on exactly one display. Display on a single screen ensures that it is easy for the firmware to set a timing and that the UI is not scaled to fit multiple displays of different sizes and aspect ratios. It is easier for the firmware to display on one display instead of many. The native resolution is important in a number of Windows scenarios:Native resolution provide the sharpest and most clear text. Booting the system in native resolution eliminates the need to change modes during the boot process. The frame buffer can be handed off between bios, boot loader, OS boot, and display driver. The result of this is that the display does not flash during boot and gives a more seamless boot experience. Providing the EDID to Windows is important so that Windows can determine the physical dimensions of the display. Windows will automatically scale its UI to be large on high DPI displays so that the text is large enough for the user to see.</p>

          <p>Description</p>
          <p>The Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) was introduced with Windows Vista as a replacement to the Windows XP Display Driver Model (XDDM). The WDDM architecture offers functionality to enable features such as desktop composition, enhanced fault Tolerance, video memory manager, scheduler, cross process sharing of D3D surfaces and so on. WDDM was specifically designed for modern graphics devices that are a minimum of Direct3D 10 Feature Level 9_3 with pixel shader 2.0 or better and have all the necessary hardware features to support the WDDM functionality of memory management, scheduling, and fault tolerance. WDDM for Windows Vista was referred to as "WDDM v1.0".  WDDM 1.0 is required for Windows Vista.Windows 7 made incremental changes to the driver model for supporting Windows 7 features and capabilities and is referred to as "WDDM v1.1" and is a strict superset of WDDM 1.0.  WDDM v1.1 introduces support for D3D11, GDI hardware acceleration, Connecting and Configuring Displays, DXVA HD, and other features. WDDM 1.1 is required for Windows 7.Windows 8 also introduces features and capabilities that require graphics driver changes. These incremental changes range from small changes such as smooth rotation, to large changes such as 3D stereo, and D3D11 video support. The WDDM driver model that provides these Windows 8 features is referred to as "WDDM v1.2" WDDM v1.2 is a superset of WDDM 1.1, and WDDM 1.0. WDDM v1.2 is required by all systems shipped with Windows 8. WDDM 1.0 and WDDM 1.1 will only be supported with legacy devices on legacy systems. The best experience, and Windows 8 specific features are only enabled by a WDDM 1.2 driver. A WDDM driver that implements some WDDM 1.2 required features, but not all required features will fail to load on Windows 8.For Windows 8 XDDM is officially retired and XDDM drivers will no longer load on Windows 8 Client or Server. </p>
          <p>Windows 8.1 introduces features and capabilities that require graphic driver changes. WDDMv1.3 brings significant improvement in areas related to performance, power and reliability for Windows. </p>
          <p>WDDMv1.3 is required by all systems shipped with Windows 8.1. </p>
          <p>Below is a summary these WDDM versions:</p>

          <p> WDDM v1.2 also introduces new types of graphics drivers, targeting specific scenarios and is described below:</p>
          <p>WDDM Full Graphics Driver: This is the full version of the WDDM graphics driver that supports hardware accelerated 2D &amp; 3D operations. This driver is fully capable of handling all the render, display and video functions. WDDM 1.0 and WDDM 1.1 are full graphics drivers. All Windows 8 client systems must have a full graphics WDDM 1.2 device as the primary boot device.</p>
          <p>WDDM Display Only Driver: This driver is only supported as a WDDM 1.2 driver and enables IHVs to write a WDDM based kernel mode driver that is capable of driving display only devices. The OS handles the 2D or 3D rendering using a software simulated GPU.</p>
          <p>WDDM Render Only Driver: This driver is only supported as a WDDM 1.2 driver and enables IHVs to write a WDDM driver that supports only rendering functionality. Render only devices are not allowed as the primary graphics device on client systems.</p>
          <p>Table below explains the scenario usage for the new driver types:</p>

          <p>System firmware must fully and accurately implement SMBIOS structures of type 16 (description of physical memory arrays) and of type 17 (description of memory devices), as permitted by the SMBIOS specification. Implementation of other SMBIOS memory description structures - Types 19, 20 and 37 - are optional.A JEDEC compliant DRAM DIMM supports Serial Presence Detect (SPD). Through this mechanism and defined standards, the module can be identified in terms of its manufacturer, serial number and other useful information. The JEDEC standards require specific data to reside in the lower 128 bytes of an EEPROM located on the memory module. Programming of this EEPROM is normally done by vendors of DRAM DIMMs at their origin of manufacture, and can optionally be redone afterward to meet their OEMs' specifications or retailers' requirements for branding purposes while going through distribution channels. The system firmware (BIOS or UEFI) probes and extracts this information from the DIMM via its SMBus interface. The system firmware uses this information to configure the memory controller. System firmware that supports SMBIOS V2.4 or later, conveys the above DIMM specific information to the operating systems and running applications via a series of SMBIOS structures ("tables") for memory descriptions. These SMBIOS structures also describe the system memory topology, geometry and characteristics. Those are briefly described here for reference purposes and can be found in the current SMBIOS V2.5 Specification (September 5, 2006): </p>
          <p>Physical Memory Array (Type 16) containing information on Location, Use and Error Correction Types; pages 51-52. </p>
          <p>Memory Array Mapped Address (Type 19) containing address mapping for a Physical Memory Array (one structure is present for each contiguous address range described); page 56. </p>
          <p>Memory Device (Type 17) containing information on Form Factor, Type and Type Detail; pages 52-54 </p>
          <p>Memory Device Mapped Address (Type 20) containing address mapping to a device-level granularity (one structure is present for each contiguous address range described); page 56. </p>
          <p>Memory Channel (Type 37) containing correlation between a Memory Channel and its associated Memory Devices (each device presents one or more loads to the channel); page 68. This support in the system firmware will: </p>
          <p>Allow the customers to manage their server memory components as deployed IT assets, and to maintain a comprehensive understanding of their investment of these assets in terms of RAS abilities and cost of ownership. </p>
          <p>Allow server and data center management solutions to exploit this information in their diagnostic tools and methods for better RAS abilities. </p>
          <p>Enable certain classes of ISV products (RAM disk, etc.) to exploit this information for better performance and functionalities on Windows platforms.</p>

          <p>Servers are required to provide mechanisms to enable reporting or communication of corrected and uncorrected system hardware errors that are available on the server to the operating system. The platform may perform thresholding of corrected errors.The minimal set of error sources are: * IA64 - Machine Check Exception, Corrected Machine Check, Corrected Platform Error, INIT, PCI Express AER * X86-64 - Machine Check Exception, Corrected Machine Check, Non Maskable Interrupt, PCI Express AER, BOOT errors.  An interface must be provided on the server to facilitate persistence of error records. The interface must preserve the error records across a server reboot and power cycle. At a minimum, the platform must provide enough storage space for one uncorrectable error record. Options to implement this interface are described in the WHEA Platform Design Guide.Windows Server provides an OSC mechanism to indicate the presence of WHEA in the OS. The server must honor these mechanisms and enable WHEA flows when the OSC is detected. Optional mechanisms are provided to enable the firmware to process error events from specified error sources before handing control off to WHEA and to communicate this behavior to the OS. This helps avoid conflicts on software handling of hardware error events. These mechanisms are described in the WHEA Platform Design Guide.Servers must support WHEA-defined interfaces for software insertion of a subset of hardware error conditions into the platform to enable WHEA validation. The injection mechanism must support the injection of one fatal uncorrected and one corrected error; each injectable error is injected using one of the error sources on the platform, and using the signaling mechanism specified for that error source. Options to provide this interface are described in the WHEA Platform Design Guide.For access to the WHEA Platform Design Guide, send e-mailto WHEAFB@Microsoft.com.  </p>
